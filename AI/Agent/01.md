# Agent 
- First off all these Agent can be open source .  So these are the good to go .
- An agent is refers to a system or program that can perceive its environment,make decision and tale actions autonomously to achive specific goals .
# Core Characteristics of an Agent 
- `Perception` Agents have the sensor that allow them to gather information from their environment. This could be anything from reading text from a document,monitoring network traffic ,or interpreting visual data from a camera .
- `Reasoning/Decision-Making` Based on the perceived information and its internal knowledge,an agent can reason plan and decide on the most appropriate course of action to achive its goals . This involves using AI techniques like larger language models (llm) for understanding and generating response .
- `Action` Agents have actuators that enables them to perform actions in  their environment. These action can be anything    from writing code,sending email,making a financial tansaction or controlling a robotic arm .
- `Autonomy`  This is crucial distinguising factor, Agents can operate independently without constant human supervison,they can initiate actions ,adapt to new information and make decisions on their own,often working towards complex,multi steps goals .
- `Learning` Most of the advance agents have the ability to learn the things by own .
- `Goal-Oriented` Most of the agents are designed with the specific goals in mind and their actions are directed towards achienving those goals .
`Simple Reflex Agents`: Act immediately based only on the current situation (no memory).
`Model-Based Reflex Agents`: Use the current situation and an internal "model" (memory) of how the world works.
`Goal-Based Agents`: Plan actions to achieve specific goals, looking ahead to future consequences.
`Utility-Based Agents`: Choose actions that maximize desirability  `"utility` even when goals conflict or there's uncertainty.
`Learning Agents`: Improve their performance over time by learning from experience.
- Gemini cli is the model-based reflex agent with the elements of a goal-based or even learning agent .
