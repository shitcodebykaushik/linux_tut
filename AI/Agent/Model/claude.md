Cluade is developed by the anthropic .
- Cto of the anthropic is Sam McCandlisj
Anthropic developed three model 
-  Haiku is the fastest and most compact model designed for the quick,near-instant responde. Its ideal for the tasks like customer support .
- Sonnet model offers a string balacne of the intelligence and speed making it suitable for a wide range of task and enterprise workloads, Its often default free model for the users .
- Opus is the most intelligent and capable model in the family .
- At its core the cluade is built on the transformer architecture,the same foundational tech used for the majour llm . Transformer uses the self attention to weigh the importance of different words in the sentence and understand their context , cluade uses the constitutional ai (supervised and reinforcement) .
- Anthropic uses the agentic and multiagent architecture . 
- MCP server is developed by the anthropic only 
-`Transformer` this is the neural network architecture that revolutionized machine learning particularly in natural language and Ai, It was introduce in the 2017 paper  `Attention Is All you need` The core mechanism is the attention mechanism which allows the model to focus on different part of the input when processing each elements. Instead of processing sequence word by word transformer can look at all words simultaneously and determine which one are most relevant to each other .
`Architecture` 
- `Enocoder-Decoder Structure`: Original transformer have two main parts-an encoder that process the input and decoder that generated output .
- `Multi-Head Attention` Multiple attention mechanism running in the paralle .
- `Feed-Forward Networks` Dense layer that process the attended information .
- `Position Encoding`  Since transformer dont process sequence in order they add positional information .
# Why trnasformer matter 
 - `Parallezation` Unlike RNNs transformer can process all parts of a sequence simultaneously making training much faster .
 - `Long-Range Dependencies` They can connect information from distant part of a sequence .
 - `Scalability` They scale well with the more data and computational power .
 -In the simplest terms, an AI agent is an autonomous software system that uses artificial intelligence to perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve a specific goal.
The key difference between a typical AI model (like a large language model you might chat with) and an AI agent is autonomy. While an LLM is reactive—it waits for your prompt and then generates a response—an AI agent is proactive and goal-oriented. It can operate on its own, often over a long period, to complete a complex task without constant human supervision.
