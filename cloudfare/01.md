- Cloudflare offers a free DNS service called 1.1.1.1 that you can use on any device,it protect our data from being analysed or used for targeting .
- `1.1.1.1` is more private then the isp  provider dns .
- Serverless means you are not supposed to worry about the the underlying infrastructure .
- Container are way of partitioning a machine or server into seprate user space environments such that each ennvironement runs only one application  and doesn't interact with any other  partioned section on the machine as each container share machine kernal with the other container but it run  as if it were the only system on the machine .
- On the  other hand serverless application are broken up into a functions and hosted by a third-party vendor who charges the application developer only based on the amount each functions runs . Serverless coumputing actually run on server  but each container lives on one machine at a time .
- Cloudfare workers are the serverless computing features .
- Containers are constantly running, and therefore cloud providers have to charge for the server space even if no one is using the application at the time.There are no continued expenses in a serverless architecture because application code does not run unless it is called. Instead, developers are only charged for the server capacity that their application does in fact use.
- Cloudflare `WARP` is the free vpn built on the top of the 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver ,aims to provide privacy.
- WARP is built on the same network that has made 1.1.1.1 one of the fasted DNS resolver on EARTH .
- WARP routes your internet traffic through Cloudflare's global network. It encrypts your data to prevent ISP tracking, hackers, and threats. It does not change your IP address or allow location spoofing like a traditional VPN.
