# Why
- Its journey started from the year 1960 .
- Through this this we can acces resource dynamically for agility and flexibility to meet customer needs .
- In this we pay as we go to test and use the system without being commited .
-  Cloud computing is defined as the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with the pay as we go for pricing .
-  Modern computing is based on the client-server model .
  - A cient is the end user .
  - A server can be services such as AMAZON ELSATIC compute cloud or any req/res model or we can say the virtual machine .
  - Delploying the cloud 
   - Cloud service and deploymet methods provide the different level of control,flexibilty and management .
   - The deployment model include the 
     - Infrastructure as model.
     - Platform as service .
     - Software as a service .
   - Deployment strategies include the following
     - Cloud -  In this we can migrate existing application to the cloud or we can design the new application in the cloud ,we can design these things at the low level and the high level too . And can scale up to the core infrastucture . 
     - HYBRID - In this cloud-based resources are connected to on-permises infrasture . 
     - On- Permises  - It is the private cloud delployment in this resource are deployed on permises by using the virtualization and resource management tools .

- It is a best practice to spread out your computing resource accross multiple availability zones to gurantee high availability ,so if one fails then also your architecture is still up  and running  .
- When a file is stored in Amazon S3,the file is redunbuntaly copied into every availabilty zone in that region. 
- AWS share the responsibility with customer .
  - AWS is responsible for the secuirty of the cloud .
     - Compute
     - Storage
     - Database
     - Networking
     - AWS global infrastructure 
  - Customers are  responsible for their security in the cloud .
    - Customer data 
    - Platform,Application, Identity and access Management 
    - OS
    - Networking and firewall configuration .
    - Client side data encryption 
  - Operationa  Excellence is the ability to run and monitor system to deliver businedd valu and to continually improve the supporting process abnd procedure .
  - Security pillar is the ability to protect the informtion .
  - Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from the infrastrucutre or service disruption .
  - Performance Efficinecy is  the ability to use computing resource . 
  - TCO is the fincial metric .
  # Insatnace 
  - An instance is a fundamental concept in cloud computing,particular in AWS and other cloud .
  - At its core an instance is a virtual server that you can use to run applications and workload in  cloud . 
  - It providing computing resource such resource such as CPU,memory,storage and netwokring. 
  - Instance are typically associated with the Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud2) .
  - We can choose the type and size of an instance based on your workload needs ./
  - An instance is a virtualized representation of a physical server .
  - Instance can run various operating system upto your wish .
  - To lauch EC2 instance on AWS we can choose AMI(Amazon machine image) which determines the operating system and the software on the instance .
  - `Elastic` Refers to the ability to dynamically scale computing resources up or down based on demand. Elasticity is cornerstone of cloud computing and allows system to handle varying workloads efficiently without requiring over-provisioning or mannual adjustments .
  - `When some one say i am giving you the one instance from my server` It simply means that they are sharing a piece of their server computing capacity with you . often isolating it so feels like your own dedicated computer .
  - `Spin up` is a casual way of saying they are launching or creating a new virtual server. By allocating the resource and allowing you to use it .One you have been given the access it like a having remote computer where we can host website run applications store and process data .
  - IP addrees and key file are the important thing for you to connect it from your end and start using it .
  - `Amazon Machine Image` is a pre-configured template used to launch an instance .
  - `Instance type` means the size and capabilities of the instance(eg t2micr)
  - `Instance` means virtual server running in the cloud .
  - `Server` refers to the physical machine or virtual instance used to run applications .
  - `VPC` refers to the virtual private isolated network for your cloud resources. 
  - Vertical scaling means increasing the size .(means upgrading the things)
  - Horizontal scaling means adding more instance (means add resourcr)
  - In Elasticity it adjust resouce to handle chages in demand .
  - Auto scaling means launces and terminates instances based on demand .
  - Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances.
  # AWS S3
   - It means amazon simple storage service .
   - Buckets are contianer for the data store in the S3 .
   - Dynamo DB is the key-value database service.It is serverless which means you do not have to provison,patch or manage servers .
  # AWS EC2 (Amazon elastic Compute cloud)
  - An instance refers to the virtual server in the cloud .
  - With EC2 we can congifgure and setup our os  uponf which our application will run .
  - EC2 determine the hardware availibility to your instance .
  - Each instance types offers a different balance of compute,memory,network and storage resource ,
  - Reserved instance are one cheaper instance for the long time runn.
  # Amazon Virtual Private cloud (Amazon VPC )
  - In this module we create our own pvt network .
  -  An VPC is an isolated portion of the AWS populate by .

  # AWS RDS (Relational Database Service )
   - It is use to set-up and scale relational database in the AWS cloud .
   - 
  # AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management )
   - It let the user with the permission accros AWS.
  # AWS lambda 
   - It is a serverless computing service that is used to process snippets of code when a lambad function os triggered .
  # AWS cloud watch 
   - It is use to monitor the stuff .
# Understanding the concept of the vps 
- When we say that we are buying an instance in the cloud computing espically with the AWS then it typically refers to provisioning and paying for the virtual machine on AWS . Commonly knows as the Elastic compute cloud .
- On demand Instance means we are renting an instancr on a `pay-as-you-go` basis .
- We pay for the compute capacity per second or per hour .
- There are concept of the reserved instance also /
- For flexible workloads we use the spot instance  and it cost much lower then the other one .
# Hostinger 
- Hostinger provdes main web solution including shared hosting ,vps hosting and wordpress hosting including the cloud hosting but the thing like IASS and Pass .
- Shared hosting 
- Vps hosting (virtual private server,more power & control).
- `Cloud hosting` scalable and faster performance .
- Minecraft server (For gaming servers)
- `200 GB` of storage space on the server to store the website files database,emails and media . Most of the hosting provider uses teh NVMs SSD or SSD which is faster than the traditional HDD storage .
- Unlimited Bandwidth means there is no strict limits in the how much data(in Gb or TB) can be transerred between your websites and the visitores . In reality there are usually fair usage policies(FUP) to prevent the extensive .
- Egress bandwidth refers to the the rate at which data is retrived from your buckets in the course of the completing request made to cloud storage .
- Network egress refers to the rate at which data is sent over the network from your buckets to requesters .
- `300 database` means you can create upto 300 MySql or PostgreSQL database .
- Unlimited FTP (File transfer Protocol) accounts for secure file transfer .
- A cdn is a network of server distributed worldwide that caches(store) copies of your website content to speed up loading times and reduce bandwidth usage . When a visitor request page the neares CDN server delivers cached files (image CSS, js) instead of sending the request to the main hosting server . The reduce the distance between server and user ,making the website load faster . Without cdn data traveks the thousand of miles which increase the latency (slow loading) , with the cdn its caches the content from the nearest one and load the data faster  which increase the latency .
- How CDN & Bandwidth Work Together
Scenario Without a CDN

Your main server directly serves all visitors. If your website has 100,000 visitors a month, and each page load is 5MB, your bandwidth usage will be:
100,000 visitors Ã— 5MB = 500GB per month If your hosting plan includes 200GB of bandwidth, you will exceed the limit and may need to pay extra.
Scenario With a CDN
With a CDN:
80% of requests are served from CDN cache.
Your main hosting server only handles 20% of traffic.Bandwidth consumption is significantly reduced.(100000 visitors Ã— 5MB) Ã— 20% = 100GB per month
You save 400GB of bandwidth!
Conclusion: Do You Need a CDN?
If your website has global visitors â†’ YES
If you want to improve speed & performance â†’ YES
If you need to reduce bandwidth costs â†’ YES
If you run an e-commerce or business site â†’ YES

If your website is small & local (few visitors, no international traffic) â†’ NO (but still recommended for security).
ðŸ”¥ Final Thoughts

    Bandwidth = The amount of data transferred from your hosting to visitors.
    CDN = A global caching system that reduces bandwidth and speeds up your website.
    Using a CDN saves bandwidth, improves performance, and protects against attacks.
- In instance we just lease the compute power of the hardware .
- If we buy the instance then it will provide me the dedicated server .
- Every vps run as independent virtual provate server which has resource lif you buy a VPS plan, you will get a dedicated portion of a serverke.
  - CPU 
  - RAM
  - Storage
  - Os 
- VPS hosting is dedicated per user. Its like apartment in the building .
- In vps we have full root access and the more isolated environment .
- VPS works through the hypervisiors tech which is software tool that works to manage the virtual machine on the physical server .
- We can coonect the vps using the SSH key from anywhere and work on it like real physical computer .
- Poor vps configuration can lead to the security issue .
# Cloud service model 
- These are charatersized by term service .  And can be accessed by many device like mobile and laptops  and all .
 - Software as a service 
   - According to the nist it means that the capabilities provided to the consumer is to use the provides appliication running on a cloud infrastructure.
   The application are accessble from various client devices through  a thin client interface . Such as Web Browser or program interface .
 -  Infrastructure as service 
   - The capabilities provided to the customer is to provision processing storge networks and other fundamental computing resource where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrart software .
   - Pass offer the compute and the operating system as service and allow cutomer to install their application on the cloud platform .
   - Compute Os STORAGE UNDERLYING HARDWARE NETWORKING THESE ARE CORE .
 - Comunication as a Service 
   - Communication as a service include hosted voice videos conferenceing and instant messaging e-mail collaboration and all othe communication .
 - Desktop as service 
   - It support virtual service that is hosted on the cloud and accessed by the desktop computers .
- On permise 
  - It means managing and creating the own cloud service 
- Of permises 
  - This means hosting a service that is located remotely from a company data center and is usually in a cloud service data center .
- Ubiquitous access refers to the ability to access cloud resource from anywhere in the network from variety of device such as laptos,smartphones and thin or thick client .
- Compute pool 
- Memeory pool 
 - There is total and finite ammount of ram installed in the bare metel or the physical server . So the ram is then virtualized by the heypervisor software into memory pools and allocated to virtual machine s .
- VPN access and internall working 
  - A VPN allows us for secure and usually encrypted connections over a public network . It creates the tunnel between users device and the remote server .
  - COrporat vpn rely on the coordinated function of the vpn server to gateway,client softwared and the underlying network infrasturce. 
  - The vpn gateway sits at the network edge. It function as bridge between the internal corporate network and the external devices ,implementing security measure for data traffic . Client software installed on employee device initiates the vpn conncetion and handles the ongoing communication with the vpn .
  - Network infrastructure includes routers switces and firwallss that maintain network interigity and facitiliate data flow .
  - Administrator define the network policy before connecting to the internet , these rules govern the flow of the traffic and dicate user permission, the involve establissing the remote connetion with the secure communication protocol ,selecting strong encryption standard and configuring network routes tht the encrypted vpn traffic will follow .
  - Once the client handshake is complete,the focus shifts to establissing the vpn tunnel,the tunnling protocol is the core that supports secure data pasage, both the client and the server agree on a tunnling protocol that suits their secuirty requirement  and network capabilities.
  - After the tunnel connection is done then focus shifts to the secure channel creation begin with the key exchange . This provide a way to securely generate and share a key between the two parties without the need to transmit the key itself over the internete . Advance DH groups is used to apply more security 
  - Once the secure channel is done IP address allocation is central to integrating the client into the network . Each vpn client is assigned an IP address from a designated pool,which is crucial for directing the packets to their proper destination . IP address enables the client device to effectively join the corporat network .
  - VPN tech offers two method of routing client traffic split and full tunnling .
  - Connection stability and controll mesaage .
    - The vpn conncection is kept alive and stable using the heartbeats and kept alive message .
    - heartbeats are the regular signal sent by one device to another to confirm the connection is active or not .
    - Keepalive are also similiar but it sents the connection prifegined interval .
    - Check sum is a value derived from the sum of bytes in a data packets, which is used to detect errors afeter the transmission .
- conncetion termination is important ;
  - Because secure closure of the connection is most important things.
   - The teardown process .
   - session cleanup is important for the post - termination step .
   - The connection termination process safegurad againsts unauthorized access and potential data leaks .
