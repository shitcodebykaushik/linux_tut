# why
- Its journey started from the year 1960 .
- Through this this we can acces resource dynamically for agility and flexibility to meet customer needs .
- In this we pay as we go to test and use the system without being commited .
-  Cloud computing is defined as the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with the pay as we go for pricing .
-  Modern computing is based on the client-server model .
  - A cient is the end user .
  - A server can be services such as AMAZON ELSATIC compute cloud or any req/res model or we can say the virtual machine .
  - Delploying the cloud 
   - Cloud service and deploymet methods provide the different level of control,flexibilty and management .
   - The deployment model include the 
     - Infrastructure as model.
     - Platform as service .
     - Software as a service .
   - Deployment strategies include the following
     - Cloud -  In this we can migrate existing application to the cloud or we can design the new application in the cloud ,we can design these things at the low level and the high level too . And can scale up to the core infrastucture . 
     - HYBRID - In this cloud-based resources are connected to on-permises infrasture . 
     - On- Permises  - It is the private cloud delployment in this resource are deployed on permises by using the virtualization and resource management tools .

- It is a best practice to spread out your computing resource accross multiple availability zones to gurantee high availability ,so if one fails then also your architecture is still up  and running  .
- When a file is stored in Amazon S3,the file is redunbuntaly copied into every availabilty zone in that region. 
- AWS share the responsibility with customer .
  - AWS is responsible for the secuirty of the cloud .
     - Compute
     - Storage
     - Database
     - Networking
     - AWS global infrastructure 
  - Customers are  responsible for their security in the cloud .
    - Customer data 
    - Platform,Application, Identity and access Management 
    - OS
    - Networking and firewall configuration .
    - Client side data encryption 
  - Operationa  Excellence is the ability to run and monitor system to deliver businedd valu and to continually improve the supporting process abnd procedure .
  - Security pillar is the ability to protect the informtion .
  - Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from the infrastrucutre or service disruption .
  - Performance Efficinecy is  the ability to use computing resource . 
  - TCO is the fincial metric .
  # AWS S3
   - It means amazon simple storage service .
   - Buckets are contianer for the data store in the S3 .
