- The primary purpose of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is to act as a universal, lightweight format for storing and exchanging data.  It provides a simple, structured, and human-readable way for different applications, systems, and programming languages to communicate with each other.Because JSON is a text-based format, it's highly portable and can be easily transmitted over a network

- jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It's essentially a "stream editor for JSON data," similar to how tools like sed and awk work for text. While curl can retrieve data in JSON format, the raw output is often hard to read and navigate. This is where jq comes in.
