# Day 1
In linux everything is file 
- pwd
  It means print working directory. Whic tells you that in which present location you are.
- whoami
  This will tell you who is login in the system.
- date [+%D]
 It will tell  you the complete date month timezone in full format.
 For the customize data or specific things realted to the time and date you can use.
- ls -ltr
 It is use to sort the file 
- ls -lth
It is use to sort the file in readable format
- Clear
 It is use to cleat the terminal or you can use `ctrl+l`.
- touch newfile_txt
 This touch command   will create the new file. 
- echo "Line to be written">file name with the format
 This will add the line in the given file .

 If you want to go to the last line of the file then just press the `SHIFT+G`.
 If you want to go to the first line directly then just press the `P`.
 Forward slash `/` is the top to bottom search. 
 Question marks is for bootom to up `?`.

 # Process Management 
 It works is to track the process.
 `ps` - process status.
  to check the process of anything just type ps -ef | grep name
  - How to get PID of process
    pgrep name of the service which you want to know the process .
    You will the process ID of running stuff only you wont get the process if of stopped thing
  -  How to stop a process ID
    `` kill -9 process_id`  // This will kill the process forcefully .
  -  How to stop procees with the name 
     `plill name `

  - How to see all the active jobs 
   Jobs are the task which we give to terminal
    `jobs`
     and ctrl+z is use to pause the job it not yet 
    bg for the process working in the background 

    # Networking part
    To check wheather the server is connected to the internet or not 
    `ping www.google.com`
    if we see that 0% packet is loss then it  is connected to the internet 
   

   # Day 2
   • You own the objects you create.
   • The special user account called “root” can act as the owner of any object,Certain system calls (e.g., settimeofday) are restricted to root.
   You control and communicate with most devices through files that represent them in /dev. Since device files are filesystem objects, they are
   subject to filesystem access control semantics. You can determine the ownerships of a file with ls -l:
   ## Root 
   Since root is just another user, most systems let you log in directly to the root account.To begin with, root logins leave no record of what operations were performed as root.Another disadvantage is that the log-in-as-root scenario leaves no record of who was actually doing the work.
   A marginally better way to access the root account is to use the `sudo` command.
   `Sudo` takes as its argument a command line to be executed as root (or as another
restricted user). sudo consults the file /etc/sudoers (/usr/local/etc/sudoers on
FreeBSD), which lists the people who are authorized to use sudo and the commands
they are allowed to run on each host. If the proposed command is permitted, sudo
prompts for the user’s own password and executes the command.
sudo keeps a log of the command lines that were executed, the hosts on which they
were run, the people who ran them, the directories from which they were run, and
the times at which they were invoked. This information can be logged by syslog or
placed in the file of your choice. 

Sudo has a couple of disadvantages as well. The worst of these is that any breach in
the security of a sudoer’s personal account can be equivalent to breaching the root
account itself., It is unfortunately not a safe way to define limited domains of autonomy or to place certain operations out of bounds.The rule is that sudo always obeys the last matching line, with matching being
determined by the entire 4-tuple of user, host, target user, and command. Each of
those elements must match the configuration line, or the line is simply ignored.
`TIP` -- Try to lock the root account using `passwd -l`
Most often, UIDs under 10 are system accounts, and UIDs between 10 and 100 are pseudo-users associated with specific pieces of software.

# Process
A process represents a running program. It’s the abstraction through which memory,
processor time, and I/O resources can be managed and monitored.
System and user processes follow the same rules, so you can use a single set of tools
to control them both.A process consists of an address space and a set of data structures within the kernel. The address space is a set of memory pages that the kernel has marked for the process’s use.Pages are the units in which memory is managed. They are usually 4KiB or 8KiB in size.A “thread” is an execution context within a process. Every process has at least one
thread, but some processes have many. Each thread has its own stack and CPU
context but operates within the address space of its enclosing process
 ## PID
The kernel assigns a unique ID number to every process.
A process’s scheduling priority determines how much CPU time it receives.
`ps -aux`- Comaand like ps show the snapshot of the system at particular time.
`ps -lax`- This works is also the same as ps-aux.but it is faster then ps-lax.
`top` -> It is the real-time version of ps that gives a regularly updated,intractive summary of process and their resource usage.
The Linux versions of ps and top read their process status information from the
/proc directory, a pseudo-filesystem in which the kernel exposes a variety of interesting information about the system’s state.


# Day 3
In linux we have single file system tree.
Attaching anything is called mounting .

- `cal` = A is default,that display a calender of the current month.
- `df` = To see the current amount of the free space in the your disk.
- `free` = To display the amount of the free memory .
- `exit` = To exit the terminal.
- `pwd` - Print the name of the current working directory
- `cd` = Change directory
- `ls` = List directory contents 
- `/dev` =This contain the device nodes.Everything is a file here kernal maintain the a         list of all the devices it understands.
- `/etc` = It maintain the system-wide configuration-file
- `/lib` = It contains the shared library files use by the core systems.
- `/opt` = It is use to store the optional software mostly it holds the commercial software.

- `127` = Means linux system was not able to find the command referenced inside the script.
- `echo ` = This prints the simple text arguments in the terminal.
- `echo` = $((any mathematical expression )) = This will simple follow the rule of the bodmas.

- `echo` { } = This will create the multiple string from the pattern containing braces.
- `su` = This command say that you are substitue user or switch user.,we just need to use su with the username of the desired account it will switch to that account.

-  `getent passwd `=The getent passwd command retrieves entries from the password database on a Linux system. This includes information about user accounts stored in the /etc/passwd file.
- `sudo userdel username` = This will  delete the user from the system.
- `history` =This will display the whole content of the of the history list.
- `id` = This is the numerical identifiar , The output will be  [`uid` This is known as the user id],[`gid` is the group id ],[`groups` are the fundamental of collection of the id  ].
- `Note` -> User accounts are defined at the /etc/passwd file, and groups are defined at the /etc/group file.
- `exit` - This command will take you to the root terminal.
- `passwd` - This will change the current password.
- `ps x` - This will give the bigger picture of what system is doing . `STAT` will be shown here which means that state abd revels the current status of the process.
- `ps-aux` - This will give the display of the process belonging to the every user.
      - USER -> this isowner of the process `User ID`
      - %CPU -> CPU usage as a percent 
      - % MEM -> Memory usage as percent
      - VSZ -> Virtual memeory size 
      - RSS -> The amount of physical memeory that is `RAM` the process is using in kilobytes.
      - Start -> Time when the process has started 

- `top` - This command display a continuously updating the system process listed in order
       - `Load average` -> It refers to the number of process that are waiting to run.
       - `Swap` -> This is swap space which means the virtual space is being used.
- `q`  - This will make you out from the shell.
