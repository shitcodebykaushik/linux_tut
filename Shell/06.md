# Shell Scripting 
 -  Shell allow us to enter the command and it represent the output
 - `BASH` acronym for broune-Again shell
 A working knoweldge of shell scripting.Consider that as a Linux machine boots.
 - `/etc/rc.d` to restore the sytem configuration  and set up service and system configuration .
 - Script is nothing but the list of the system commands stored in a file .

  # Commnet
  This is functionallity of the commnet  
- Lines begins with the `#` are commnet and will not be executed .
- There no method to terminate the comment .
-  A quotes or an escaped  # in echo statement doesnt begin a commnet .
    - echo may used for the number conversion 
        - eg :- echo $(( 3#101011)).
        -  Ecplanation :- In base-3, each digit's position represents a power of 3.
        - So, breaking down 101011:( 1 * 3^5 + 0 * 3^4 + 1 * 3^3 + 0 * 3^2 + 1 * 3^1 +  1 * 3^0 ).
 - Command seperator [semicolon].Permits putting two or more command on the same line . The result will be in two different line .
 - Terminator in `case` option [double semicolo].
   ```Rust
   variable="abc"case "$variable" in
    abc) echo "\$variable = 78" ;;
    ac) echo "\$variable = abc" ;;
    *) echo "Value of \$variable does not match any pattern" ;; esac
 - `esac` it is use to end the case staement .

  # Dot 

  - `.` Represents the current directory.
  - `..` Represents the parent directory (the directory one level above the current directory).
  
# Startinh off
Script is nothing more then a list of the system command stored in the text file .

- A sript to clean up log files in `/var/log`
   ```bash
     cd/var/log
     cat/dev/null>message
     cat/dev/null>wtmp
     echo "Log file cleaned up . "
   ```

  - A log file is a file that records events, processes, messages, and other data generated by operating systems, software applications, and other devices. These files are used for tracking the operation of a system, diagnosing issues, and monitoring activities .
  -- Dont but somehow i changed my self from the zsh to bash 
   - restarting is necessary ,
   - bash --version
   - chsh -s /bin/bash 
  
# Series from learn Linux 
- echo $SHELL
- `which bash` This is command prompt which is used to find the location of the bash executable in the system path . When we search this then system search this in the path environement variable .'

- Script is the text file that has one or more commands written inside when executed

- Steps to create the script 
  - nano
  - write the command 
  - save the file name with the .sh extension 
  - chmod +x filname
  - run the file with the ./filename 
  - To know what is inside the scripts file just run the cat filename .
  - `Ctrl+o` Save 
  - We can write the multiple types of command in the script file and run at one line without any writing them multiple times . THis is knownm as the automation .
  - #!/bin/bash - This is going to be the first line which tell the system that which is interepeter the system is going to use .
