# Shell Scripting 
 -  Shell allow us to enter the command and it represent the output
 - `BASH` acronym for broune-Again shell
 A working knoweldge of shell scripting.Consider that as a Linux machine boots.
 - `/etc/rc.d` to restore the sytem configuration  and set up service and system configuration .
 - Script is nothing but the list of the system commands stored in a file .

  # Comment
  This is functionallity of the commnet  
- Lines begins with the `#` are commnet and will not be executed .
- There no method to terminate the comment .
-  A quotes or an escaped  # in echo statement doesnt begin a commnet .
    - echo may used for the number conversion 
        - eg :- echo $(( 3#101011)).
        -  Ecplanation :- In base-3, each digit's position represents a power of 3.
        - So, breaking down 101011:( 1 * 3^5 + 0 * 3^4 + 1 * 3^3 + 0 * 3^2 + 1 * 3^1 +  1 * 3^0 ).
 - Command seperator [semicolon].Permits putting two or more command on the same line . The result will be in two different line .
 - Terminator in `case` option [double semicolo].
   ```Rust
   variable="abc"case "$variable" in
    abc) echo "\$variable = 78" ;;
    ac) echo "\$variable = abc" ;;
    *) echo "Value of \$variable does not match any pattern" ;; esac
 - `esac` it is use to end the case staement .

  # Dot 

  - `.` Represents the current directory.
  - `..` Represents the parent directory (the directory one level above the current directory).
  
# Startinh off
Script is nothing more then a list of the system command stored in the text file .

- A sript to clean up log files in `/var/log`
   ```bash
     cd/var/log
     cat/dev/null>message
     cat/dev/null>wtmp
     echo "Log file cleaned up . "
   ```

  - A log file is a file that records events, processes, messages, and other data generated by operating systems, software applications, and other devices. These files are used for tracking the operation of a system, diagnosing issues, and monitoring activities .
  -- Dont but somehow i changed my self from the zsh to bash 
   - restarting is necessary ,
   - bash --version
   - chsh -s /bin/bash 
  
# Series from learn Linux 
- echo $SHELL
- `which bash` This is command prompt which is used to find the location of the bash executable in the system path . When we search this then system search this in the path environement variable .'

- Script is the text file that has one or more commands written inside when executed

- Steps to create the script 
  - nano
  - write the command 
  - save the file name with the .sh extension 
  - chmod +x filname
  - run the file with the ./filename 
  - To know what is inside the scripts file just run the cat filename .
  - `Ctrl+o` Save 
  - We can write the multiple types of command in the script file and run at one line without any writing them multiple times . THis is knownm as the automation .
  - #!/bin/bash - This is going to be the first line which tell the system that which is interepeter the system is going to use .
# Variable 
 - It allow us to save information is for futuer use .
 - We can create the varible like variable_name = "Data" 
 - We cab call variable like echo $variable_name  .
 - Note $is important because it will help you to prvent from the collison of the command  .
 - In nano  `ctrl+k` will delete the everything  which are in single line .
 - We can use multiple variable at a time  .
 - It is mandotry to give space betweeb the echo  command  .
 - It is important to use the $ in in the echo command .
 - There are bunch of the vraible already there in the system variable .
 - In bash varibale are untyped means that they are all considered character string .
 - `name=kausik` this will create the variable .
 - echo $name` This will print the data of the variable .







 - Type env to find the underlying variable  in the sytem .
 # Math 
 - expr 10+3  This will work fine . as expr is mathematical way of the bash . // This doesnt  .
 # If statement 
 # Exit code
  - It helps to determine wheather the command was succesfull or not .
  - Exit code zero means the command was successful . Any thing else other then zero means it is not successful .
  - Scripts run at the schedule 
  - Home screen  is not the best for the practise .
  - Always try to put the script in the central location .
  - FHS  
  - move the script file into the /usr/local/bin 
    - steps to move the file are as followed 
      - mv filename /usr/local/bin 
      - To confirm this just type this ls -l /user/local/bin  Here you can see the moved file .
      - Once the file has been moved you need to just type the file name to run the automation .
      - There is no need to run the ./filename at all once you are done with the making the script file as the centralized file .
  - file extension are not required huh .
  - The memory location are grouped called pages .
  - One of the major responsibility of the kenral is hardware management . Any device that the linux system must communicate with needs driver code inserted inside the kernal code . The driver code allows the kernal to pass the data pack back and forth to the device acting as the middle-man between application and the hardware .
  # Dolev Farhi 
  - Bash allow us to interact with the component of the Linux operating system .
  - `bash --version ` This will print the version depending upon the version the system .
  - echo ${osname}
  - echo ${hostname}
  - echo ${uid}
  - echo $ {groups}
  - echo $ {SHELL}
  - Linux can accept many argument types of imput on the command line.
  `#! usr/bin/bash` This is shebang which is use to specify the interpeter for the scriot execution .
  - Bash wait for the line by line code  to finish until the it finishe before advancing to the next line .
  -  `chmod +x fd.file` , ./filename.md to run the script .
  - Shell stands for the replc 


- Bash 
- `%s` This is the format specifier in the bash script and printf always expect for this  .
- The term same buffer modified  refers to a situatin where  a single storage location (buffer) is resused for new data ,overwriting its previous content .
-  Remember this printf command will always  look for the output  and will be captured .
