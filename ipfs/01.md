# IPFS 
- The interplanetary file system (IPFS) is p2p protocol for storing and sharing files in the distributed manner . It aims to make the web faster ,safer and more open by changing how we locate and movw data. Unlike traditional client and server model of the internet,where content is accessed from a central location. IPFS retrives content from multiple nodes at once, creating more resilient and efficient system.

- The core innovation of IPFS lies in its use of content addressing instead of the location addressing used by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

- Currently we give the `url` which is the pin point which indicates where our resources are stored . If that server is down the content is inaccessible . 
- On the other hand IPFS identifies content by what it is not by where it is , Every file added to the IPFS networki is given a unique crpyptpgraphic hash know as Content Identifier (CID) ,this cid is generated based on the file content when you want to retrive a file on IPFS,you request it by its CID, The ipfs network then find the nodes that are storing that specific content and delivers it you from the nearest or most available sources ,
- Any change in file will result change in the cid.this insure the integrity of the content .

# RFID 
- The core concept is connecting the RFID UIDs to IPFS CIDs. Its like making the physical objects traceable and their data  accessible .
- The data record remains accessible through pinata .
