# cUrl 
- The full form is the `CLIENT_URL` is roboust command-line tool designed for transferring data between  a client (local machine) and a server (remote machine) over the internet or the other network. Its design is built on the principle of the data exchange via URL (Uniform Resource Locators) using a wide  array of supported protocols .
- `cURL` supports over 20 protocols enabling seamless communication with the web server file and the API .
- `cURL` supports stateless communication which means  it doest not maintain a session between requests .
- `cURL` is  a client that initiates requests to server and handles the response .
- `Request/Response Paradigm` 
   - Sending requests to server as user have the ability to define the `GET,POST,PUT` and include headers parameters or payloads .
   - `Processing Responses` from the server are either displayed in the terminal or stored in file for the further use .
   -  `Uplaoding data` Supports HTTP methods like `POST,PUT and DELETE` to upload or modify data .
   - `HTTP/HTTPS` for web communication 
   - `FTP/FTPS`  for transferring files to/form FTP.
   - `SCP/SFTP` for secure file  transfer over ssh  .
   - `SMTP/POP3/IMAP` for email communication .
   - `Curl` supports pipeling supports HTTP pipeling enabling multiple requests over a single connection .
   - `Pipelinig` in the context of `HTTP` and `curl` refers to the techniques of sending multiple HTTP request over a single TCP connection without waiting for the corresponding response to arrive . Reduced latency ans it eliminated the idle time while waiting for responses . Allowa for multiple resource to be fethched concurrently over the same connection .
   - `Headers` are the pieces of the additional information (metadata) sent along with HTTP request or responses . Headers are like notes attached to package . with the curl `-I` default metadata is sent to the server and the response we get from the server .
     - `Requests headers` are sent by the client to the server to provide details about the request or how the client expects the server to responds .
     - `Response headeers` are sent by the server to the client to provide details about the response 
     - `Body` are the actual data content of the package .
     - `Pacakge` in terms of the network means  a small unit of data sent across a network .When data is transmitted from one computer to another , it is broken into packets which are reassembled at the destination .
     - `Package` in terms of APIs and HTTP  is a package refers to the entire `request` or `response` over the network. `Header`,`Body` and `URL`(address of the resource being accessed).
      ``POST /api/data HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        Authorization: Bearer TOKEN123
        Content-Type: application/json
        {
         "name": "John Doe",
          "age": 30
        }```
    
#### Breakdown
- **Request Line**: `POST /api/data HTTP/1.1`
- **Headers**:
  - `Host: example.com`: Specifies the domain the request is for.
  - `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN123`: Provides the token for authentication.
  - `Content-Type: application/json`: Specifies the format of the request body.
- **Body (Payload)**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30
  }

- The payload means content or data you are transferring as part of the communication between client and the server .
- There are two types of the payload :
   - Request payload  = Data sent by the client to the server .
   - Response payload = Data sent by the server back to the client .
- Well Payload is not equal to the headers .
  - Payload is part of the body and contains the actual data .
  - Headers provide metadata about the request or payloads .
  - Content type define payload format .
    - `Content-type: application/json` Payload is json
    - `Content-Type: application/xml`  Payload is xml
    -  `Content-Type: txt/plain`   Payload is plain 
- Parameter is the additional information given to a program or function .
- **Options and Flag** 
  - Options and flags are parameters that modify the behaviour of the command  they allow you to customize the command to perform the specific actions,pass additional data or control  how the tool operates .
  - Flags are like switches or settings you turn on or off when you run a command . They modify how a command works . Flag start with the  `-` (dash) or `--`(double dash)
- **Flag** 
  - `-d` 
     - It send data in the http post request body .
     - It is mostly used in the sending the data from the json payloads to server .
  - `h` 
     - It helps information about the curl specific subject .
     - It helps to guide you .
  - `-o`
     - Saves the responses to a specified file instead of displaying it in the terminal.
     - It is use to download the files and saving then=m with the custom name .
  - `-O` 
    - Save the response to a file name the same as the remote file .
    - When downloading a file and you want it to have the same name as on the server .
  - `-i`
    - Display the http response header along with the response body .
    - When we need to see the metadata about the server response .
  - `-s`
    - It run the command in silent mode suppressing progress and error messages .
    - When scripting or running commands where you dont want any unnecessary output .
  -  `-T`
    -  Upload a files to the specified destination
    - We use this when we wish to transfer the local file to remote server .
 -  `-u`
    - Provided the username and the password for the server authentication 
    - When we try to access the protected resource or API that require authentication .
 -  `-A`
    - It sets the User-Agent string sent to the server , identifying the client .
    - It is mostly used to specific browser or application .
 -  `v` 
    - It makes the request more talkative showing the detailed information about what curl is doing .
    - For debugging or troubleshooting we use this .
 -  `-V` 
    - This display the curl version .
    - Use to chek the installed version of the curl .

# CORS
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing 
- It is a security features in browsers . Browsers block request from one website to another unless the server allows it .
- CORS header tell the browser yes this website is allowed to access my data .
- We use CORS to stop malicious website from freely making API calls on your behalf .
- CORS applies only in browser not in postman ,curl these tools ignore the cors .
