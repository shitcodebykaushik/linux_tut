# JSON 

- Stands for the **JavaScript Object Notation**.
- We use javascript words because JSON was originally derived from the syntax of JavaScript .Now it is language independent .One of the reason is that in JavaScript objects are written in the key value pairs .
- It is the lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read, write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is widely used for storing and exchanging data between a server and a web application.
- JSON is a text format that is completely language independent.

## **Structure of JSON**

- **Objects**: It is the unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with the `{` left brace and ends with the `}` right brace.
- **Array**: Enclosed in square brackets `[]`, holding a list of values.
- **Primitive**: Includes `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, and `Null`.

### **Data Types in JSON**

- **String**
  - Text value enclosed in double quotes.

- **Number**
  - Can be integers or decimals.

- **Boolean**
  - Represents logical values: `true` or `false`.

- **Null**
  - Represents the absence of a value.

- **Array**
  - Ordered collection of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

- **Object**
  - Unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- The colon seprate the key and its associated value .
- The comma seprate the multiple - key value pairs in the json object .
- The json object end with the right curly braces .
### Example JSON Object:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 101,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "preferences": {
      "theme": "dark",
      "notifications": true
    }
  },
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Laptop",
      "price": 799.99,
      "available": true
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Smartphone",
      "price": 499.99,
      "available": false
    }
  ],
  "orderTotal": 1299.98,
  "success": true
}
```

### **Common Use Cases of JSON**

- **API Communication**: JSON serves as the primary format for exchanging data between applications and servers.
- **Database Storage**: MongoDB and other NoSQL databases store JSON-like documents.
- **Configuration Files**: Used for application settings and tool configurations (e.g., `package.json` in Node.js).

- Parsing means analyzing and converting data into a format that a program can understand and work with it . It is essentially the process of breaking  down raw data into smaller,more meaningfull parts to extract information or make it usuable .
- `Synchronous` means you wait until your coffee is ready before you do anything else .
- `Asynchronous` means you place your order find a seat and read book while waiting. When your coffee is ready they call you and you pick it up without wasitng time in standing in line .
