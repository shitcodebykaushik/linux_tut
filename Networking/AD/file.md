- AD means active directory which is now known as the  AZURE AD .
- AD is a directory service for windows network environment . It is distributed heirachical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization . It allows the organization to  to stroe the data that makes it available to both the user and administrator  on the same netwoek .
- Ad was first shipped with the windows 2000 . But it had come under many attack in the recent year .
- Ad misconfiguration often lead to obtain the foothold (internal acces )
- Ad is the large database that are accessible to all the users reagardless of their domain within the network .
- 
- There are always the noPac attack in the pentesting , 
- In year 2021 we have these major vulnerability .
  - PrintNightmare 
  - The shadow credentials 
  - noPac
- 2022 
  - ZeroLogon made the attacker to impersonate any unpatched domain controller in a network .
  -   
-  There is the resource-based constrained delegation .
- 2023
  - Printer Bug was discovered and Poc tool was released .
- Ad is arranged in the hierarchical tree structure . 
- Forst active directory can contain one or more domains.
- Active directory provides authentication and authorization within a window domain environment .
-  There one root domain and it contains the child or tree root .
 - It is common to see the multiple domain linked together via trust relationship in the organisation that perform a lot of acquisitions ,
-  Object can be defined as Any resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs,printers ,users.
- And every objects in Active directory has an associated set of  attributes used to define characteristic of the given  object .
- Schema is the blueprint of any enterprise environment . It defines what tpyes of objects can exit in the AD database and their associated attributes .
- A domain is the logical group of the object  such as the computers users ,groups etc .
- A forest is the collection of the active directory domains .
- A tree is a collection of the Active directory domains that begins  at a single root domain .
- A forest is a collection of AD trees .
- Each domain tree share the boundry with the other domains .
- A parent- child relationship is formed when a domain is added under the another domain in thre tree 
- Container objects hold other objects and have defined place in the directory.
- Leaf objects are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy .
- A GUID is a unique 128 bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created . It is uniwue across the enterprise . It is stored into the ObjectGUID attribute ,
- Security principal is anything that an OS can authenticate ,including users computers accounts ot even threads/process that run in the context of the user or computer account .
- In AD security principal are the domain objects that can manages access to other resource .
- Security identifier is used as unique identifier for a security group . It can be used only omcvre
- Distinguished name describe the full path to an object in AD .
- Relative Distinguished Name is a single compnent of the  Distinguished Name that identifies the object . 
- MSBROWSE is the Microsoft networking protocol which was used in the early days .
- NTDS.DIT is the heart of the ACTIVE Directory .
- sIDHistort holds any SIDS that an objects was assigned previously. It is mostly used in the  migrastion so a user can maintain the same level of the access when migrated from the one domaint to another .
- SYSVOL stores the copies of the public files in the domain such as system policies .
- AD Recycle Bin is use to faciliate the recovery of deleted AD Objects . This made the sysadmin to restore the objects ,avoiding the need to restore from backups .
- Tombstone is a container object that holds deleted AD objects . 
- A gloabl catalog (GC) is a domain cotroller that stores copies of all objects in an Active directory forest . The GC stores a full copy of all objects in the current domain .
# Active Directory objects  
- Object is anyresource present within the Active Directory .
- User are the considered leaf objects which means that they cannot contain any other objects within them .
- Contact objects is usually used to represent an external user and contains informations attributes such a first name,last name etc .
- Printers objects points to a printer accessible within the AD network .
- Computer objects are the computer that are coonected to the AD network .
- A shared folder objects points to the shared folder specific computer where the folder resides. 
- A container us considered a container objects because it can contain other objecrts .
- Domain controllers are essentially  the brains of the AD network .
- Sites in AD is a set of computers across one or more subnets connected using high speed  .
- Domain is the structure of the network .
- Ou is the Organizational unit is a container that systems administartion can use to store the simliar objects  for ease of administrative .


# Windows actice directory 
- Windows actice directory is the backbone of the corporate world . It simplifies the management of devices and users within the corporate environment. 
- Windows domain is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business . The main ideas behind the domain is to centralise the administration of common components of windows computer in the single repositiry callled Active Directory (AD).
- The server that run the AD is knows as the domain controller (DC).
- Centralisation and the Managing the security policy is the main idea of the domain controller .
- The core of the windows domain is the active directory domain service (AD DS) . This service acts as a catalouge that holds the information of all of the objects that exits on your network .
- We have the many object in the AD 
  - Users are the one of the object that knows the security principal meaning they can be authenticated by the domain and can be assigned privileges over resources like file or printers . User are use to represent two type of the things one is the people [represent the person in the organisation] and other is services [ they have the priviliage to run the specific services ] .
  - Machine are the object in the AD DS 
  - 
- So far we have organised user and computers in OUs just for the sake of it ,but the main ideas behind this is to be able to deploy different policies for each OU.
- Windows manges such policies through the group policies objects .

- Using ubuntu from now onwards
