- AD means active directory which is now known as the  AZURE AD .
- AD is a directory service for windowa network environment . It is distributed heirachical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization . It allows the organization to  to stroe the data that makes it available to both the user and administrator  on the same netwoek .
- Ad was first shipped with the windows 2000 . But it had come under many attack in the recent year .
- Ad misconfiguration often lead to obtain the foothold (internal acces )
- Ad is the large database that are accessible to all the users reagardless of their domain within the network .
- 
- There are always the noPac attack in the pentesting , 
- In year 2021 we have these major vulnerability .
  - PrintNightmare 
  - The shadow credentials 
  - noPac
- 2022 
  - ZeroLogon made the attacker to impersonate any unpatched domain controller in a network .
  -   
-  There is the resource-based constrained delegation .
- 2023
  - Printer Bug was discovered and Poc tool was released .
- Ad is arranged in the hierarchical tree structure . 
- Forst active directory can contain one or more domains.
- Active directory provides authentication and authorization within a window domain environment .
-  There one root domain and it contains the child or tree root .
 - It is common to see the multiple domain linked together via trust relationship in the organisation that perform a lot of acquisitions ,
-  Object can be defined as Any resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs,printers ,users.
- And every objects in Active directory has an associated set of  attributes used to define characteristic of the given  object .
- Schema is the blueprint of any enterprise environment . It defines what tpyes of objects can exit in the AD database and their associated attributes .
- A domain is the logical group of the object  such as the computers users ,groups etc .
- A forest is the collection of the active directory domains .
- A tree is a collection of the Active directory domains that begins  at a single root domain .
- A forest is a collection of AD trees .
- Each domain tree share the boundry with the other domains .
- A parent- child relationship is formed when a domain is added under the another domain in thre tree 
- Container objects hold other objects and have defined place in the directory.
- Leaf objects are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy .
- A GUID is a unique 128 bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created . It is uniwue across the enterprise . It is stored into the ObjectGUID attribute ,
- Security principal is anything that an OS can authenticate ,including users computers accounts ot even threads/process that run in the context of the user or computer account .
- In AD security principal are the domain objects that can manages access to other resource .
- Security identifier is used as unique identifier for a security group . It can be used only omcvre
- Distinguished name describe the full path to an object in AD .
- Relative Distinguished Name is a single compnent of the  Distinguished Name that identifies the object . 
- MSBROWSE is the Microsoft networking protocol which was used in the early days .
- NTDS.DIT is the heart of the ACTIVE Directory .
- sIDHistort holds any SIDS that an objects was assigned previously. It is mostly used in the  migrastion so a user can maintain the same level of the access when migrated from the one domaint to another .
- SYSVOL stores the copies of the public files in the domain such as system policies .
- AD Recycle Bin is use to faciliate the recovery of deleted AD Objects . This made the sysadmin to restore the objects ,avoiding the need to restore from backups .
- Tombstone is a container object that holds deleted AD objects . 
- A gloabl catalog (GC) is a domain cotroller that stores copies of all objects in an Active directory forest . The GC stores a full copy of all objects in the current domain .
