- A shell is the software that allows a user to interact with the os . It can be graphical interface but it usucally be the command- line interface and this depends on the operating system .
- In cybersecurity it usually  refers to the specific session an attacker uses when the accessing a compromised system allowing them to run commands and execute software . 
-  Shell helps the attacker to execute commands remotely on the target machine .
-  It helps the attacker to esclate the privileges to more eleveted or administrative access .
-  Once the attacker access to execute commands through the obtained shell  they can explore the system to read and copy the data from it  .
-  Post-Exploation Activities as the shell has been accessed attacker can perform the following actions such as the deploying the malware creating the hidden account etc .
- Access the system to access the systemn   network . Depending on goal of the attacker
- A reverse shell is also called connect back shell is one of the most popular techniques for gaining access to the system in the cyber.
-  A revese shell will connect back to the attacker machine . This machine will waiting for a connection .
- nc is the netcat listner 
-  Bind shell will bind a port on the compromised system and listen for the connection, when this connection occurs,it exposes the shell session so the atacker can execute the commands remotely .
-  `1024` is the port number which requirs root access or privilged permissions .
- Netcat is the one of the utility that will allow us to handle the connection and allow the attacker to interact with the exposed shell .
- Rlwrap is the small utility that uses the GNU readline library to providing editing keyboard and history .
- Ncat is the improved version of the Netcat distributed by the NMAP,it provides the extra fetures like the encryptions ssl .
- Socat is the utility that allows you to create socket connections between two data sources .
- The revese shell creates named pipe using mkfifo and connects to the attacker via Telnet on the `ATTACKET_IP`
- `PHP` reverse shell payload method is a common scripting language that uses the exec,shell_exec,system,passthru and the popen function to execturs commands remotely through TCP connection .
-  A web shell is a scrip written in a language supported by a compromised web server that executes commands through the web server itself . 
-  A web shell is usually a file containing the code that executes commands and the handles files .
- pown-Shell is the minimalistic single file php web shell that allow remote command execution .
- `b374k` shell is rich php web shell with the file managemnet and the command exection .
- c99 shell is robust php web shell with the extensive functionality .

# Web Basic 
- URL stand for the uniform resource locator . It is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet .
- `Schema+user+host/domain+port+path+querystring+fragment`. 
- Schema are the protocol use to acces the website .
- `User` Some url include the user details  for the sites authentication . 
- `Host/Domain` It is the most important part of the URL it tells you which part of the website you are accesing . Every domain has to be unique and is registered through domain registerars .
- `Port` It is the number of the port where the website is hosted . It like the doorway to use for the communication . 
- `Path` The path points to the specific file or directory on the server .
- `Query` string is the part of the URL that provides additional information about the resource .
- `Fragments` Starts with the hash symbol (#) and contains the id of the element on the page .It helps to a specific section of the webpage .
- `typosquatting` is a fraudulent act of using a common or misspelled domain name to create a new one .
-  `HTTP`  message are the packets of the data that are exchanged between user and the client and the web server .
-  `HTTP Request` These are the sent from the user to trigger actions on the web application . This is the first point of the contact .
-  `HTTP Response` These are the messages sent from the server to the user .
-  `Start` it like the introduction of the message 
-  `Headers`  these are made up of key value pairs,it contains the extra information to be conveyed to the web server about the request 
-  `Empty`  it is a little divider that seprated the header from the body .0  
-  `Body`  these is where the actual data are stored .
-  `Options` Is the method used to check the availability of a resource .
-   In XML formattion data is structures inside the labels called tags which have the opening and the closing .
-  In URL encoded the data structure in a key and the value where key=value .
-  In Form Data allows multiple of the data blocks to be sent where each block is seperated by boundry string . The boundry string is defined header of the request itself .
-  In json data is formatted in pairs of name:value  multiple pairs are seprated by commas .
-  Status line provide the http version status code and the brief explanation .
-  `200-299`   This means everything is working as expected .
-  `300-399`   Redirection error .
-  `400-499` This means the error is with the request .
-  `500-599` This means the error is within the server .
- Http header improve the overall security of the web application by providing the mitgations against attacks like Cross-Site Scripting .
- Content Security Policy  in this we have the default src which specify the default policy `script-src` It specify the policy for where scripts can loaded from the which is self along with the scripts , style-src is the policy for the css styles .
- `Strict Transport Security (hSTs)` This will always ensure that web browser will always connect over the HTTPS .
   -max-age is the expiry time in seconds for this setting
   - includeSubDomains is to include the subdomains in the hsts policy.
   - preload is the optional setting allow the websites to be included in preload lists 
- X-Content-Type-Options 
- Referre-Policy 

#  Windows Commannd Line 
- Once you master the command line you will find it faster and more efficient .
- The main usuage of the cli are the following 
  - Lower resource usuage - As the cli uses the fewer system require than the graphics 
  -  Automation - While you automate  GUI task , creating it with the commands make it easier to repeat the task .
  - Remote Management CLI make it very convenint to use the ssh to manage a remoe system suuch as server,router or an IOT device . 
  - cmd.exe is the default command line of the windows .
  - systeminfo is the command that will give the whole information about the windows system .
  - `tracert` stands for the trace route .
  - `nslookup` is to looks for the host or domain and return its IP address .
  - `netstat` is the command which is used to display the current network connection and display the listtening port .
  - `ss` this is replacing the netstat in the linux system .
  - `snake oil` is rhe cryptograpic methods or product considered bogus or fraudulent . 
  - `Shodan` is the search engine for the device connected to the internet .
  - `Censys` it focus on the interner-connected hosts,website and certificate .
  -  `VirusTotal` provides a virus-scannig service for files using the multiple antivirus engine .
  - `Have I been Pwned` tells you if an email address has appeared in the leaked data breach  .

  # Packets and Frames 
  - Packets and Frames are small piece of the data that, when forming together make a larger piece of information or  message .
  - A frame is at the layer 2 . at the data link layer meaning there is no such information as IP address . This stage is also called encapsulation .
  -  A packets is at the layer 3 .
  -  A packets have different structure that are dependant upon the type of packets that is being sent . 
  -  There are different headers in the packets 
     - Time to live 
     - Checksum fields provide the intergrity for checing for the protocols 
     - Source Address  contains the IP address of the device  that the packets is being sent from so that data knows where to return 
     - Destination Address it contains the IP address the packets is being sent to so  that the data knows where to travel next .
     - Sequence  number the first piece of the data is given the random number .
     - Acknowledgement number is the number next to the sequence number .
     - Data is the byte of the file that is being transmitted is stored .
     - Flag  this is the header that determines how the packet should handled by either device during the handshake process. Specific flag will determin specific behaviour .
     - SYN is the initial packet sent by the  client during the handshake . This packet is uset to initiate a connection  and synchronise the two device together .
     - SYN/ACK  This is the packet sent by the reciveing device to Acknowledgement to syncronise attempt to the client .
     - ACK is used by either the client or server to acknowledge that a series of message/packets have been succesfully received .
     - Fin is used to clenaly close the connection after it has been complete .
     - RST this end all the communication .

- UDP 
- It stands for the user data gram protocol.
- It is the stateless protocol means it doesnt require the constant connection .
- It is the protocl where lost of data is accepted .
- Unstable connection result to the teriible expericen .
- UDP have fewer connections .
- Ports are the point in which data can be exchanged .
- Port forwarding is the essential component in connceting the application and service to the internet . WIthout port formwarding , application and service such as servers are only availbale to device within the same direct network . It opens the specific port and it is done at the router of the network .
- Firwall is a device within a network responsible for determing what traffic is allowed to enter and exit. Stateful and stateless are the two different type of the firewall .
- VPN create the desicated path between each other over the internet .  Device connected within this tunnel form their own pvt network.
- Router job is to connect network and pass data between them . Id does this by using routing (hence the name router) .
- Routing simply checks the most optimal path in which these chunks of the data should be sent .
- Router is the labels given to the process of the data travelling across network.  Routing involves creating a path between network so that this data can be successfully  delivered .
- Switch is dedicated networking device responsible for providing means  of connection to multiple device , it can facilitate many form 3 to 63 using cabels .
- Switch can operate at both layer 2 and layer 3 of the OSI model .they are exclusive in the sense  that layer 2 switches canot operate at layer 3 .
- OSI stand for the open system interconnection model  is an fundamentals models used in the networking .
- OSI consist of the 7-layers .
  - Application is the top most layer of the osi where it is determined how the rules and the policy should be .
  - Presentation this layers is the place where standarisation takes place this layer acts as translator for data to and from the application layer .
  - session it helps to maintain the connection to the other computer .
  - Transport this layer dealt with the transmitting of the data .  
  - Network it is the place where the magic of the routing and re-assembly of data takes place. Some protocols at this layer determines exactly what is the optimal path that data should take to reach a device . OSPF (Open shortes path first) and the RIP (Routing information protocol) . At this  layer everything is dealt with via IP address .
  - Data link it focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives the packets from t he network layer and add in the physical MAC address of the receiveing endpoints . Mac address can be spoofed .
  - Physical refers to the physical components of the network 
- Encapsulation is the term which means that some pieces of the information get added to the data .
