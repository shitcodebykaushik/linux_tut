# Cisco packet tracer 
- Well this is the simulation tool for the network concept , its provide the drag and drop option to configure the networking tool, Everything here will be in the simulation mode .It is the risk free learning environemt . As it is the visual simulation too,It architecture is not about the physical but rather its cross-platform visual simulation engine that imitates the function of real networking device .
- Hands on configuration is the core purpose of the cisco packet tracer .
- OSI model visulaization is one of the ability to visulaze how data flows through the different layers .
- A simulator, as the name suggests, simulates network devices and its environment,
so protocols in Packet Tracer are coded to work and behave in the same way as they would on real hardware .
- Network device form the core of the networking,



# Creating Peer-to-Peer Network .
It is decentralized network architecture where individual device are equally privaileged and can act as both clients and server,this is in contrast to the the traditional client-server model ,where client request service from the the centralized server .
- We cant share the resource directly without IP (Internet Protocol).As we know the IP address serves as the unique identifier for a device on a network .
- Two primary method for assigining an IP address to a device on network,the main difference lies in wheather the assignment is automated or mannual .
 ## DHCP 
 - It is automated system  for IP configuration,When a device connects to a netwoek it send out a request and A DHCP sever on the network automaticall assign to it .
 # Static IP 
 - A static IP is a permanet mannually configured IP address that doesnt change.

- Two devices are in the same subnet because the first  n` parts of their IP addresses are identical and they share the same subnet mask . This configuration allow them to communicate direclty with each other without needing the router ,as they recognize that they are part of the same local network .
- If the network id are different of the two or n pc then subnet mask will be different . Here we need router to communicate .
- If the netwoek id is same then two or n pc will have the same subnet mask . Here we dont need 
# The Role of the Subnet Mask
The subnet mask acts as a filter. When a device wants to send data to another IP address, it performs a logical AND operation with its own IP address and subnet mask. It then does the same for the destination IP address. If the two resulting network addresses match, the device knows the destination is on its local network and can send the data directly. If they don't match, the device knows it has to send the data to a router to get it to a different network . 
- The subnet mask have the many benefit but the only drawback is  IP Address Waste Increased Network Cost and increased Complexity and humna error .
