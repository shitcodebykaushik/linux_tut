# Cisco packet tracer 
- Well this is the simulation tool for the network concept , its provide the drag and drop option to configure the networking tool, Everything here will be in the simulation mode .It is the risk free learning environemt . As it is the visual simulation too,It architecture is not about the physical but rather its cross-platform visual simulation engine that imitates the function of real networking device .
- Hands on configuration is the core purpose of the cisco packet tracer .
- OSI model visulaization is one of the ability to visulaze how data flows through the different layers .
- A simulator, as the name suggests, simulates network devices and its environment,
so protocols in Packet Tracer are coded to work and behave in the same way as they would on real hardware .
- Network device form the core of the networking,



# Creating Peer-to-Peer Network .
It is decentralized network architecture where individual device are equally privaileged and can act as both clients and server,this is in contrast to the the traditional client-server model ,where client request service from the the centralized server .
- We cant share the resource directly without IP (Internet Protocol).As we know the IP address serves as the unique identifier for a device on a network .
- Two primary method for assigining an IP address to a device on network,the main difference lies in wheather the assignment is automated or mannual .
 ## DHCP 
 - It is automated system  for IP configuration,When a device connects to a netwoek it send out a request and A DHCP sever on the network automaticall assign to it .
 # Static IP 
 - A static IP is a permanet mannually configured IP address that doesnt change.

- Two devices are in the same subnet because the first  n` parts of their IP addresses are identical and they share the same subnet mask . This configuration allow them to communicate direclty with each other without needing the router ,as they recognize that they are part of the same local network .
- If the network id are different of the two or n pc then subnet mask will be different . Here we need router to communicate .
- If the netwoek id is same then two or n pc will have the same subnet mask . Here we dont need 
# The Role of the Subnet Mask
The subnet mask acts as a filter. When a device wants to send data to another IP address, it performs a logical AND operation with its own IP address and subnet mask. It then does the same for the destination IP address. If the two resulting network addresses match, the device knows the destination is on its local network and can send the data directly. If they don't match, the device knows it has to send the data to a router to get it to a different network . 
- The subnet mask have the many benefit but the only drawback is  IP Address Waste Increased Network Cost and increased Complexity and humna error .

 # Networking device 
- When we need to connect multiple device which can be computer or any other device to share resources or communicate . 
- The hub and switch <NIC>,Modem,AccessPoints,are the one of the most common imporatant networking device .
# Hub
- A hub is a fundamental networking device that connects multiple devices in a local area network (LAN). It operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and acts as a central connection point for all devices. When a hub receives a data packet from one device, it simply broadcasts that packet to all other connected devices, regardless of the intended recipient.Because a hub broadcasts all data, it creates a single collision domain, meaning if two devices try to transmit data at the same time, their signals can collide, causing network congestion and requiring a re-transmission. This inefficiency is a major reason why hubs have been largely replaced by more intelligent devices like switches in modern networks 
- Ultimately, hubs are considered "dumb" devices because they have no data-filtering or processing capabilities. They are not aware of IP or MAC addresses and simply replicate data to every port
# Switches
- A switch is a network device that connects multiple computers and other devices on a local area network (LAN) and manages the flow of data between them. It operates at Layer 2 (the data link layer) of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. Unlike a hub, a switch doesn't broadcast data to every port; it intelligently sends the data only to the specific device that needs to receive it. This makes a switch a much more efficient and secure networking device.
- Working of the Switches 
- When a data packet arrives at a switch, the switch examines its header to read the destination device's MAC address. It then looks up that address in a special internal table called a MAC address table (or CAM table). This table stores a list of MAC addresses and their corresponding ports on the switch.
- Types of Switches
Unmanaged Switches: These are the simplest type of switch, often used in home networks. They require no configuration and are plug-and-play. They don't have a command-line interface or any advanced features.

Managed Switches: These switches offer advanced features, such as VLANs (Virtual LANs), quality of service (QoS) settings, and port security. They are used in enterprise networks to provide more control and security over network traffic.
- Hubs and swtiches are in the different layer because of their fundamental difference in how they process and forward data. A hub only deals with the bits,while switches understand data frames and addresses .wtich specifically looks at the MAC address in the data frame,this intelligent fowarding is a key function of layer2 and is what makes a swith so much more effiecient than a hub .

- Both switches and routers are essential networking devices,but they perform different function and operates at different layer OSI model,The primary difference lies in their purpose. Switche connefts device within a single network,while a router connects different network together .
# Practical qs 
- Make P2p network with the two device .
- Establish router with the n device .
- Establish switches  with the n device .
