# Cisco packet tracer 
- Well this is the simulation tool for the network concept , its provide the drag and drop option to configure the networking tool, Everything here will be in the simulation mode .It is the risk free learning environemt . As it is the visual simulation too,It architecture is not about the physical but rather its cross-platform visula simulation engine that imitates the function of real networking device .
- Hands on configuration is the core purpose of the cisco packet tracer .
- OSI model visulaization is one of the ability to visulaze how data flows through the different layers .
- A simulator, as the name suggests, simulates network devices and its environment,
so protocols in Packet Tracer are coded to work and behave in the same way as they would on real hardware .
- Network device form the core of the networking,
