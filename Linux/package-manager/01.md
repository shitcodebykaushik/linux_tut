# Package 
- All the collection of the software are listed here 
- The RPM package is the official for the  red hat 

# Standard Stream & pipes 
- All program output/input goes into the standard input/output stream .
- Stream is the flow of the program .
- Standard input 
- Standard output 
- Standard error 
- Redirection 
- Output redirection  `>` `>>` .
- Input  redirection   `<`
- Error redirection  `2>` 
```bash 
echo "This is new hub">file.txt  
cat file.txt          
This is new hub
 echo "Here i am administratior ">>file.txt   // here we appended in the file 
cat file.txt                               
This is new hub
Here i am administratior 
```
# Pipes 
- It is the way for the two process to communicate each other .
- Here we connect the input of one to the ouput of the other  .
# Standard streams & redirection

Unix-like programs communicate using three standard streams:

- stdin (file descriptor 0) — standard input for a program
- stdout (fd 1) — standard output (normal program output)
- stderr (fd 2) — standard error (error and diagnostic messages)

Redirection lets you connect these streams to files or other programs:

- `>`  : redirect stdout to a file (overwrite)
- `>>` : redirect stdout to a file (append)
- `<`  : redirect a file to stdin
- `2>` : redirect stderr to a file
- `&>` or `> file 2>&1` : redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file

Examples:

```bash
# Write a string to a file (overwrite)
echo "This is new text" > file.txt

# Append a line to the same file
echo "Here I am administrator" >> file.txt

# Show file contents
cat file.txt
```



Pipes connect the stdout of one command to the stdin of another using `|`.

Examples:

```bash
# List directory contents and filter for directories
ls -l | grep '^d'

# Show running processes, filter and sort
ps aux | grep ssh | sort -k2 -n

# Count unique lines (common pattern: pipeline of commands)
cat /var/log/syslog | grep "error" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

Notes:

- Redirection and pipes are often combined — for example, capture the stderr of a pipeline:
  `cmd1 | cmd2 2>errors.log`
- Use parentheses to redirect the output of a group of commands: `(cmd1; cmd2) > combined.log`
