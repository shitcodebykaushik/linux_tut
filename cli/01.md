# CLI development 
- A cli is the text based interface used to interact with the computer program or operating system , instead of using the mouse to click or menus,you type of command into a terminal and the computer responds with the text outputs .
- It is the essentially conversational channel with your computers operating system or a specific  application .
- At its the CLI operates on a simple Read-Eval-Print loop (REPL).
- Prompt: The CLI displays a prompt indicating that its ready for you input.This prompt often shows your current working directory  or user .
- Eval stand for the evaluation .
- It parses any arguments or option you provided  .
- There are three main components of the cli 
  - `Terminal emulator` - It is the graphical representation that we see on the system is the essentially a sopishticed text display and the input device . It capotes your keystroke,converts them into the character sequences and sends them to the underlying shell .
  - `The shell (interpret)` -  The is the programs that runs inside terminal emulator,it is the central brain of the cli . This is where magic happens the shell perform several steps. 
    -  `Tokenization` Break the input line into the individual 'words' or token.
    - Redirection and Pipe Handling variable substitution all these things happen here .
  - CLI first check if the command is one of its own built-in-commands . If its the own then it  executes directly within own process . Own process is always known as the parent process .
  - `Path Resolution`: If it's not a built-in, the shell looks for an executable file with that name. It searches through the directories listed in the PATH environment variable (e.g., /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin). It takes the first executable file it finds.
  - `Forking` If an external command is found, the shell uses the fork() system call to created a new identical child process . This child process is a copy of the shell process .
  - `The operating system kernel` 
     - The kernel is the core of the os and it performs the low-level task at the shell request .
     -  `Process Management`The kernel manges the creation,scheduling and termination of the process .
     - I`File System management` It handles the all file operation (reading writing creation deleting) 
     - `Memory Management` Allocates the memory for the process .
 - `Parent process ` It is the process that initiate the creation of the another process by using the fork() and system call . The fork() return the PID(process ID) of the newly created child process to the parent.this allow the parent to keep track of its children . A parent can control its child process. It wait for the child to complete it execution using the system call. Parent often control the resource management and communication with the children . 
 - `Child process` This is the new process that is created by another process it is created when it parent executes a process creation system .
 - `Child is the copy of the parent initially .
 - The parent and child can communicate using various inter process mechanism . 
  - Pipes - unidirectional communication channels 
  - Shared Memory Region of the memory that both the process can access .
  - Sockets FOr network based or local communication .
 - Often, a child process immediately calls an exec system call (like exec) to replace its entire code and data segments with a new program. This is how shells run commands .
# SSH 
- At core SSH allow you to securely access the command-line interface of a remote computer over an unsecure network line internet .It create the encrypted tunnel for communication protecting your data from tampering .
- The clint and server perform the cryptographic handshake  .
- On remote side a daemon call sshd is constantly running and listing for the incoming ssh connection usually on port 22 . Once the auth is successful then it launch the child process on the remote machine .
- In app based ClI the app own the REPL .
