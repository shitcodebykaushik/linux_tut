# Express sql server on the ubuntu 
- `sudo systemctl start mssql-server` This will start the server instance in the ubuntu server .
- `sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa` this will connect with the running instance of the server . 
- `Attribute` Are the name of the column .
-  It is the SQL database not a Nosql database . It is RDBMS as the core purpose of the sql server in all its edition is to manage the relational data. It stores the data in highly structural format of table with the rows and columns . These are designed to follow the ACID properties . And it enforces the fixed schema ,before inserting the data it required to .
- The database itself is the physical collection of files and data on the hard drive .
- The instance is the engine that allows you tp interact with that data .
- A statement refers to the piece of text that the database system can interpret as a valid commnad . It is important to note that SQL statements are terminated by a semicolon `;` .
- 
# Schema 
- It is logical structure of a database,it defines how data is organized and the rules that govern it, without containing any of the actual data.It is the unchanging formal defination of the db ,the schema is created using Data Defination Language,`CREATE TABLE` AND `ALTER TABLE ` command,once the schema is in place,you can populate the database instance by inserting data .


# Azure 
- Using the azure data studio for the client side interface .
- Downloaded the thing from the snap as the original version was giving error .
- `Lpu123456789#` Azure local host 

# Data type 
- SQL data type define the kind of data a column can hold,ensuring the data integrity and optimizing storage. While there are many specific types,they fall into three main categories .
   # Numeric 
     - INT: A standard integer type ;
       - TINYINT,SMALLINT,BIGINT
   - String 
     - VARCHAR(n) A variable-legth string ,it stores only the characters you input saving space,n specifies the maxium length . This is very common type names,addresses and other text fields .
   - date/time 
   - `DATE` Stores only the data in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` .
   - `TIME` Stores only the time in the format `HH:MM:SS 
   - `DATETIME OR TIMESTAMP` Stores both the date and time .`TIMESTAMP` is often used for logging when a row was created or last updated .
   - `YEAR` Stores a year in a 2-or 4-digit format .


# DDL And DML 
- These two are the important categories of commands in th SQL . They both handle two completely different aspects of a database: its structure and its data .

- `DDL`:Data Defination Language`
   - DDL commands are used to define or change the structure of a database ,they are for the blueprint of the db not the data itself.when you run the ddl command,the change is permanent and often cannot be undone with a simpe rollback .
   `CREATE`  To create new database objects like tables,views or schemas .
   `ALTER`  To modify the structure of an existing objects,such as adding or deleting a column from table .
   `DROP` To completely delete a database object and all of its data .
   `TRUNCATE` To quickly remove all data from the table while keeping the data intact .

   -`DML`
    - DML  are used to manage the data stored withing database structure defined by ddl,they are working with the information inside the tables.DML changes can typically be rolled back if you make a mistake. SELECT INSERT UPDATE DELETE these are the commands for the dml .
  
   - 
# USE 
- This tell the compiler to use which db it should use .
- `USE BCA` this will use the database BCA if it exit in the server .
- 

# Clause 
- In SQL clauses are utilised to executes specific function or operation . 
- It is customary to write clause in SQL statement using capital letters .
- A parameter is set of value column or data types that are provided to clause as an input argument .
- `Insert Into` statement is use to insert the row to a table . And alone insert into is clause .
Here is the exaple for the isertion .
```sql
insert INTO  employee (employee_id,employee_name,department) Values (4,'Marcus Garcia','Product'),(5,'Samantha Park','Hr');
```
# And 
- And clause is used along with where to filter the  table based on 2 seperate conditions .
- Any query  containing AND will return a result ONLY if all condition are true .
```sql 
select * from flights where origin = 'Mumbain' and passenger_id BETWEEN 10001 AND 10007;
```
- `or` 
- The OR clause is used along with where to filter the table which meets any one of the given multiple conditions . Any query containing OR will return a result if ANY of the conditions is true .
- 
# ER 
- It is like blueprint of the database ,showing  how different 
pieces of information are  created .
# Components of ERD 
- Entities 
- Attrubutes are the properties 
- Relationship 


# Alter 

- `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to change the structure of an exiting table.
- Add a New Column or we can say it is use to append a new column to an exiting table .
- While altering the table we can either kepp
 ```SQL
 
 ALTER TABLE studentsDetails
 ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
 --  This query will add new column like email to the studentsdetails table . 
 
 ```
 - We have the option to alter the  tabel with the default value too 
 ```sql
 Alter table employee 
ADD column Hourly_Pay INT default  100;

select * from employee;
 ```
 # Update 
 - The update statement is used to edit a row or multiple rows in a table .
 ```sql
 update student   # Here the student is the table name
 SET Age =6
 WHERE student_id = 23 ;
 ``` 
 # Delete 
 - The delete from statement is used to remove one or more multiple rows from a table .
 - We can use the statement when we want to delete the exisiting records .
```sql
Delete From student
Where student_id = 08;
```

# Aggregate function 
- It is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values and then return a single,summarized value. These function are essential for the summarizing data which is useful for creating the reports and performing statistical analysis .
- `COUNT()` -> Counts the number of rows,inlcuding the null values.
- `SUM()` -> Calculates the average of all values in a numberic column .
- `MIN ()` -> Finds the minium value in a column.
- `MAX ()` -> Finds the maxium value in a column .


# sys.tables 
-  This is the system view in the sql server. System view are special built-in tables that store metadata about the database itself,it will list all the user-created tables in the current.



# Keys 
- A keys is column or set of column used to uniquely identify records in table. Key are the fundamental to the relational model as they define the relationships between tables which is the relational part of relational database .
- `Primary Key` - A primary key is column in the database .It  is used to uniquely identifies each row in a table .It can not contains duplicate or NULL values. It enforcess the uniqueness. Meaning no two rows can have the same primary key value and it cannot be NULL .

`Unique`
- It ensure that all valuse in a column are distinct .
- Unlike a primary key,a column with a unique constrains can have NULL values (unless explicitly marked as NOT NULL) .
```sql
title varchar(255) unique
```
 `Not Null`
- Prevents a column from having NULL values .
- Ensure that every row must have a valid(non-null) value for the specified column .
```sql
id INT NOT NULL
```
`Default`
- Assigns a default value to a column when no value is provided during  an INSERT operation .
```sql
age INT DEFAULT 10
```
`Auto Increment` 
- Automatically generates a unique sequential value for a column (usually for primary keys)
- Commonly used  with `INTEGER` primary keys .
```sql
CREATE TABLE USERS (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
);

```







- `Foreign Key` -> A column in one table that links to the primary key if another table. It establishes a relationship between the two table .

# Joins 

- Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them This is how you retrive data from multiple tables in a single query .

- `INNER JOIN` Returns only the rows that have matching values in both table .
- `LEFT JOIN` Return all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table . If there is no match the right-side columns will contain contains `NULL` values .

# Transaction 
- A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single indivisble unit of work. The entire set of operation either succeeds completely (its commited) or fails completely(is rolled back) This insure the data inergrity  and consistency .
- Transaction follows the ACID properties 
   - `Atomicity` All or nothing  If any part of the transaction fails the entire transaction fails and the database is restored to its state before the transaction begin .
   - `Consistency` A transaction must bring the database from one valid state to another .
   - `Isolation` Concurrent transaction do not interfere each other . Its as if each transaction is running in isolation .
   - `Durability` Once a transaction is commited its changes are permanent and will surivie a system crash. 

# Indexing 
- An indexing is a data structre that improve the speed of data retrival operation on database table . However too many indexing can slow down data modification operations .
- Normalization is the process of organizing the data in database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a large table into smaller,related tables and defining relationships between them .
# 



# Connection 
- We can connect two database .
  - Using sql joins. This is the most common method when the two databases are on the same  server or accessible throgh the same connection .You can use a `join` operation to combine tables from different databses in a single query .
  - `Using Linked Servers` (SQL server) 
     - A linked server allows a sql server instance to executes commands against another database instance ,this creates a permanent names connection to the other server .
# Encryption 
- It is the process of scrabling data into an unreadable format . This protects the data even if it falls into the wrong hands .
- `Encryption at Rest` Encrypts data when it is stored on disk (in disk files or backup). If a physical device is stoles the data remains unreadable .
- `Encryption in Transit` Encrypts data as it moves between the application and the database server. This is the vital for protection data sent over public network .

# Audinting and Logging 
- Auditing involves trackling and recording all database activities,such as who access the data what they did and when .
- Logs provide a provide record of all events which is essential for the security analysis .


# Backups and recovery 
- `Backup`Regularly scheduled copies of your database
- `Recovery` The process of restoring a database from a backup. The ability to perform a point in time recovery is essentail to minimize data loss .

# Constraints
- These provides details about the usuage of a column and are applied after specifying the column's data type . They enable the database to reject any data that violated a particular constraints .
# Integrity Constraints 
- These features ensure the accurarcy and consistency of the data itself,preventing logical errors.
# Primary key 
- Primary keys can be utilized to uniquely identify a row in a table .
# Unique 
- This make the column to contains the distinct values for each row,similiar to primary key column,but unlike primary key columns , a table can have multiple uniquue column.
# NOT NULL 
- This make sure that column must have  a value assigned to them .
- When attempt to insert a row without providing a value for a 'NOT NULL' column  a constrain violation will occur,preventing the insertion of the new row .
# CHECK 
- This constraint is used to enforce specific coditions on column values in a table . It ensures that only valid data that meets the defined condition can be inserted or updated in the column,if a value violated the condition,the database rejectes the operation .
# Foregin key 
- Foreign keys
  - Primary key of the one table is the foreign key for another . As foreign key is use to connect two table . Here the information is in two table and we when fetch the data it comes in one table .
- Check and Not Null constraints 
- Null  means missing or unknown data .
# Default Constraint .
- Default contraint 
# Query 
- Queries are used to talk to the database and carry out specific actions .
`select*from Flights;` This will view all rows of a table .
-`select column_1 column_2 this will show the data from the specific column`
- Here we have 
  - `select` this is the select command .
  - `*`     this will select all .
  - `from`   This is the clause  .
  - `flights` This is the name of the table .
- `Distinct` This will give the all unique value of the column from entire table.
   `select Distinct Origin from Flights`
- Using the `where clause` with the value in it .
   `select*from flights where origin = 'Mumbai' `
   - Here we have set the value of the origin  Mumbai .

-`Between` 
- The between clause is used along with where to filter the table based on 2 values.
- `select passenger_id Between 10001 AND 10007`
# Attributes 
- Attributes are the name of the column.
- Attributes are the properties or characteristics of an entity ,they provide more details about entity . In simple terms attributes are the columns in a table in a database while the entity is the table irself .
- KEy attributes is basically something unique that help us identify each record distinctly,like finderprint .
- Key attributes is represented by an oval with underlying lines .
- Must be unique (no duplicate allowed) 
- Should rarely or never change 
- Often used as refernce in orher tables .
- Composite attributes is represented by comprising simple attributes .

# Relationship 
- A relationship is a connection or association between specifi entities .
- A relationship is represented by a diamong and connecting the entities  with line .
