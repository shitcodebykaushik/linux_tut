# Makefile 
It is a special-format text file used by the make utility to automate the compilation and building of the software projects and more generally to describe how to create the target files like exce or libraries from the source file .
- A make file consist of a set of rules. Each rule typically look like this .
  - target:dependencies 
     - command1
     - command2
  - target is the file you want to create .
  - `Dependencies` are the files or targets that the target depends on . If any of the dependecies are newer than the target or if the target doesn't exit,the commands will be executed .
  - `commands` These are the sheel command that make executes to create or update the target. Each command line must start with the tab character .
  - Makefile is so poerful for the automation .It is much more efficient for automating the build process and managing the project dependencies . These are the fundamental to many open source projects .
  - Makefiles are most commonly used in situation where you need to automate a process that involves dependencies and increamental updates . While their historical and strongest association is with compiling software , particulaly in C and C++,their utility extends far .
# Linters 
 - Linters analyze the code statically without running it against a predefined set of rule . It is the automated cheking for the programmatic and stylistic errors as well as adherence to coding standars . Its done using a `lint` tool or `linter` . Linter are a crucila step in CI/CD pipelines. If the code fails liniting checks,the build can be stopped, preventing problamatic code from the being merged into the main branch or deployed .
 - js have the `ESLint` .
 - Python have the `Pylint`
 - Go have the `Golint`
 - In short it is the fundamental practice in the modern software development that significantly contributes to higher code quality ,consistency and a more effcient development workflow .

# Parsing 
- It is the fundamental process by which a computer programm understands the structure and meaning of the source code or data files writtten in a specific language .
- When you compile a program the compilers frontend is essentially a parser. It takes your .cpp ,.java, .py file and transform them into the an abstract syntax tress .
