# gRPC
- gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework created by Google.It allows services running on different machines (and written in different languages) to communicate as if they were calling local functions.
- Protobuf is Compact,stronglt-typed binary .
serialization .

- Serialization means converting an in-memory object(data structure) into a format that can be stored or transmitted over network .
- So when we runs or complied code this data lives in memory (RAM) in a format only Go understands,you cant just raw memory to another computer or save it to a file . so we convert it into a format such as JSON XML Protobuf Binary and MessagePack . Serialization is important because computers communicate,they dont share memory they communicate by sending bytes through:
  - Network sockets 
  - HTTP/2 streams
  - Files,pipes etc 
- So we need a way to convert encode complex data into a standard format that both end understand .


- In REST,communication happen via 
   - HTTP verbs (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
   - JSON payload
   - URIs as endoints 
- In gRPC communication happens via :
   - RPC methods (remote function)
   - Protocol Buffers (protobuf) message 
   - HTTP/2 transport for performance 

- Instead of sending JSON,gRPC sends the binary data defined in `.proto` files .
# How gRPC works 
- Define your contract 
   - You define your service and message in a `.proto` files 
   - Using the `protoc` compiler you generate language-specific code .
   - This generates :
      - Client stub -> code to call the remote method .
      - Server stub -> code to implement the method .

- Error handling: gRPC uses status codes (UNAVAILABLE,NOT_FOUND)
- Security: TLS is commonly used to secure gRPC traffic .
- Streaming types :
  - Unary: Single request,single response 
  - Server-streaming  single of requests,single response .
  - Client-streaming: stream of requests,single response .


# RPC 
- RPC stand for the Remote Procedure Call 
- It is way for program on one computer to call a function (procedure) that runs on another  computer,as if it were local function .

- RPC is the base communication model  for distributed system and microservices .

- This is mostly used in the low latency system . Where low latency means time taken for request to travel from client to server then server to client .Avoid hitting database for every request .
-  Make multiple backend requests concurerently .
- Avoid heavy data formates XML or json .
- A low latency system is one designed to respond in milisecond,not seconds,even under massive scale .
- Micorservices + Docker = latency isolation .
