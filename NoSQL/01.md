# Couchbase 
Couchbase is a distributed document database with a powerful search engine and in-built operational and analytical capabilities. It brings the power of NoSQL to the edge and provides fast, efficient bidirectional synchronization of data between the edge and the cloud.
- A modern shell to interact with Couchbase Server and Capella, now available.
- It is database as a service . Which is build to 
- Rollback is supported to revert the database to a specific point
- Keys and values are treated as an arbitrary binary.
- With features like memory-first architecture, geo-distributed deployments, and workload isolation, Couchbase Server excels at supporting mission-critical applications at scale while maintaining sub-millisecond latencies and 99.999% availability. Plus, with the most comprehensive SQL-compatible query language (N1QL), migrating from RDBMS to Couchbase Server is easy with ANSI join. \
- Couchbase is normally a CP type system meaning it provides consistency and partition tolerance, or it can be set up as an AP system with multiple clusters. 
- A document is the most basic unit of data manipulation in Couchbase Server. Documents are stored in JSON document format with no predefined schemas. Non-JSON documents can also be stored in Couchbase Server (binary, serialized values, XML .
- Couchbase Server includes a built-in multi-threaded object-managed cache that implements memcached compatible APIs such as get, set, delete, append, prepend etc.
- Couchbase Server is designed to provide easy-to-scale key-value .
- Couchbase Server has a tail-append storage design that is immune to data corruption, OOM killers or sudden loss of power. Data is written to the data file in an append-only manner, which enables Couchbase to do mostly sequential writes for update, and provide an optimized access patterns for disk I/O. 
- Replication in computing refers to maintaining multiple copies of data, processes, or resources to ensure consistency across redundant components .
- `Data replication` where the same data is stored on multiple storage devices
- In computer operating systems, memory paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous memory allocation .
- A partition is a division of a logical database or its constituent elements into distinct independent parts. Database partitioning refers to intentionally breaking a large database into smaller ones for scalability purposes, distinct from network partitions which are a type of network fault between nodes.[1] In a partitioned database, each piece of data belongs to exactly one partition, effectively making each partition a small database of its own.[1] Database partitioning is normally done for manageability, performance or availability[2] reasons, or for load balancing. It is popular in distributed database management systems, where each partition may be spread over multiple nodes, with users at the node performing local transactions on the partition. This increases performance for sites that have regular transactions involving certain views of data, whilst maintaining availability and security.
Partitioning enables distribution of datasets across multiple disks and query loads across multiple processors. For queries that operate on a single partition, each node executes queries independently on its local partition, enabling linear scaling of query throughput with additional nodes. 
- Partitioning is commonly implemented alongside replication, storing partition copies across multiple nodes. Each record belongs to one partition but may exist on multiple nodes for fault tolerance. In leader-follower replication systems, nodes can simultaneously serve as leaders for some partitions and followers for others .
- Partitioning aims to distribute data and query load evenly across nodes. With ideal distribution, system capacity scales linearly with added nodesâ€”ten nodes should process ten times the data and throughput of a single node. Uneven distribution, termed skew, reduces partitioning efficiency. Partitions with excessive load are called hot spots. 
- Horizontal partitioning involves putting different rows into different tables
- Vertical partitioning involves creating tables with fewer columns and using additional tables to store the remaining columns.
