# AI
- Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks .
- Generative AI, sometimes called "gen AI", refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content—such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more—in response to a user’s prompt or request.
At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data, and then draw from that representation to create new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.
- Ai systems rely on the data sets .

# Distiliation 
- It is the process where we take the big model and reduce it in the smaller one without reducing the performance .
- The deepseek researcher have  distilled there model into the quwen and the Lamma 3 .
- Chain of thought make the model clear and Reniforcement make it learn better .
- Chain of thought prompting is an approach in artificial intelligence that simulates human-like reasoning processes by delineating complex tasks into a sequence of logical steps towards a final resolution. This methodology reflects a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, offering a structured mechanism for problem-solving
- There was change from typing to the tapping in the icon .
- Monolithic models are trained on a fixed dataset, and that limits what they know and what they can do. They’re hard to adapt. If you want a model to perform better, you need more data, more time, and more resources.
- A compound AI system takes a model and integrates it with other components, like databases, APIs, or verification tools. Instead of relying solely on the model, the system can search a database, retrieve the exact number of vacation days left, and give you a correct answer.Compound AI is modular. You combine the right tools for the task. You don’t need to retrain a massive model; you can plug in different components as needed. This makes compound systems easier to build and adapt.
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a popular type of compound AI. RAG systems use a model to generate responses, but they also search for real-time information. If your system only searches your HR database, it works great for vacation queries but fails if you ask about the weather. The system’s logic is fixed. It follows a set path. 
- Reasoning Acting(containe tools which help to search ) and memory are the three core of the Agent .
- We can use the ReAct framework to build the ai agents which contains both the acting and the reasoning .
- AI agents are systems that use large language models (LLMs) to dynamically reason, plan, and execute tasks by integrating external tools and memory.
