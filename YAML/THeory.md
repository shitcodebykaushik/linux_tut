- YANT MARKUP LANGUAGE 
- It is the serilization language . It helps to coummunicate in two different lanugage/system/tech .
- It is important for making the efficient data managemnt system and automation ,
- It is the great tool for server and cloud .
- It object serialization abilities make it viable replacemnt for the language like JSon .
- We can have multiple yaml file under one yaml file . The seperation between each documents is marked by the three dashess (---)
- YAML allow you to add commands to files using the hash symbol (#) similiar to python commnets .
- YAML uses the indentation system similar to python to show the structure of the program . And we are required to use space to create the indentation rather then the tabs to avoid confusion .
- YAML cuts the use cases of the quoatation marks,brackets,and the braces  these formating specification increases the readability of the files beyond XML and the json .
- YAML offers auto detetecting data types while also supporting explict typing(means declaring specific type of variable ) .
- As a data-representation format yaml does not contain executables . It is therefore save to exchange yaml files with the external parties .
- In Yaml most of the things are the key-value pair  where `key` represent the `pairs` name and `value` represent the data linked to that name . It is the unique within that file .
- Scaler represnt the single stored value  .
- String are the collection of the character that represent a sentence or phrase   We use `|` to print each string as a new line and `>` to print as a paragraph .
- YAML is use to create the automation protocol that can executes a series of command listed in the YAML file .
- Writing a automation file depends on some specific tools or the system  .
 - Automation is use to perfom task or process with the minimal or no human  intervation .
 -  Continous integration refers to the practice of the automatically and frequently integration code changes into shared source code repository .
 - Continous delivery  or deployemt refers to the integration ,testing and delivery of code changes . CI/CD automates the manual intervation traditionally needed to get new code from a commint into the prodution downtime is minimise and code release happen faster  .
- Yaml file are used for the writing the automation of the following tools .
  -  Github Action 
  -  Ansible Playbook (IT Automation )
  -  Kubernetes (Infrastructure Autoamtion )
  - Docker Composes (Container Automation)
  - CircleCl (Cl/CD Automation)

- YAML is powerful language that can be used for configuration files, message beetween application and saving application state . 
- YAML helps to create the multi container file in the docker compose .
 - A multi-container application is a software that is composed of multiple container each running a disctinct components or service of the application ,rather than bundling evenrything into a single container ,multicontainer approcah leaverage the miscorservice architecture by sepearating doffernet concerns into independent containers which can communicate with each other .
 - Each container run single service . This keeps service modular allowing easier maintainece updates and scaling .
 - Container communicate over the internal network in the docker .
 -  We can scale each service independenlty  based on the apolication need .
 - Multicontianer follow the MICROSERVICE container allowing them distribute the task .
 - A container is  standard unit of the software that package up code and all its dependencies so the application run quickely and reliably from one computing environment to another .
