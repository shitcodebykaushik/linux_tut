- This is it. Containers are the next once-in-a-decade shift in infrastructure and process that makesor break you .
- The Ops perspective will download an image start a new container log in to the new container,run the command inside it and destroy it .
- The dev perspective will pull some cdoe from the github,inspect a dockerfile ,containerize the app run it as container . 
- Host to container (Serverless)
- It is the next object to compute .
- The solution is for developer
- Moby dock
- Gordon (Turtle) is the main theme of the  docker .
- Docker is all about the speed 
- Devlop faster 
- Build Faster 
- Test Faster
- Deploy Faster 
- Update Faster
- Recover Faster
 - `Docker engine/server/deamon` It  is the infrastructure pluging software that runs and orchestrates the continer . It is the core container run time that run the container ,
 - Container are the building block of the docker .
 - `docker version` It will verifiy that wheather cli can talk to engine or not . 
 - `docker info`  It will give most config value
 - `docker`

- `image` An image is the application that we want to run . It it all the binary and   libiray source code that make the application . It is an object that contain os filesystem and the applicaton,It is the stopped container ,in terms of developer we can say that it is the class .`
- `container` A container is the an instance that image running as a process. 

- `docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx.`
 This will download image 'nginx' from docker hub and will start a new container from that image after that it will opened the port `80` on the host IP . Routed that trafiic to the container IP, port 80 .
 We dont want to run this always so we use `ctrl+c` and type the command like `docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach ngnix
 Detach  will tell the program to run in the background .
 
 - What happens in 'docker container run '?
    - There is misconception that the docker is running a container in background but there is lot which is happening in the background .
    - But in depth it looks for the image locally in image cache . If it doesnt find the anything then it will look for the remote image repository (default to docker hub) and download the latest version .
    - Then its going to creates a new container based on the that image and prepare to start it doesn't make a copy of the image ,it just start on the layer of the changes .
    - Then it gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside the docker engine
    - Opens up the port on the host and forward to port in container.
    - Starts the container by using the `CMD` in the image Dockerfile .

- Contianer VS Vm
   - Container are the just process,and it is limited to what rresource they can access.
   - Exist when the process stops .
   - Container run over the host .

    # The homework section is left .

- What go inside the container 
 - `docker top` It will process list in one container.
 - `docker inspect` It will give details of one container config.
 - `docker stats`  It will give the performance stats of all containers

- Getting a shell inside Containers 
`docker run -it --name Proxy nginx bash` This comand will let you run terminal inside the server. The problem is with the git bash as it is not configured yet so use powershell. 


 # Dokcer networking
 - All are extrernally exposed ports cloesed by defult. But exposing manually is better for the securities purpose.
 - Their inter communication never leave host .


- Each container connected to a private virtual network "bridge"
- Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP
- All containers on virtual network can talk to each other without -p
- Best practice is to create a new virtual networl for each app :
-  "Batteries included ,But Removable"
    - Defaults work well in many cases,but easy to swap out parts to customize it .
- Make new virtaul networks
- Attach containers to more then one virtual network (or none )
- Skip virtual network and use host IP (--net=host) 
- Use different Docker network driver to gain new abilities.
 - You can list one port at the one time .
 `Command line`
  - `docker container run -p 80:80 --name webhost -d nginx`
    - This is going to create a new container with the image of nginx and the name is webhost along with the port 80:80 .
  - `docker container port webhost`
  - To check the IP Addres we use this command
  ` docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' webhost`

 # Docker Network: CLI Management 

- `docker network ls`
   This will show you the all network that has been created .It will list the Network ID ,NAME,Driver,Scope.

- `docker network inspect bridge`
   This will list the bridge network .
- `docker netowork create my_app_net`
   This will create the virtual network with the driver
   Network driver build-in or 3rd party extension that give you virtual network features.
   - `docker network disconnect` 
   This will disconnect the network .

# Docker Network DNS
Understand how DNS  is the key to easy inter-container comms
See how it works by default with the custom 
Learn how to use -link to enable DNS on default bridg network .
Docker daemon has a built in DNS server that container use by default .
 # Assignment 14,15,14,18 .
 

 # What is Image
  - App binaries and dependencies
  - Metadata about the image data and hoe to run the imge
  - An image is an ordered collection of the root filesystem chancges and the correspoind exection parameters for use within a container runtime .
  - Not complete OS,No kernal,kernal module (eg drivers) .
  - Small as one file (your app binary) like golang static binary .
  - Big as a Ubuntu distro with apt and Apache PHP and more intalled .
  - All try to pull the official image .
  - `docker pull image name ` This is the command to download the image by default it will download the lates one  .
  - You can create your own image and make them to available to the public .
  - docker hub is apt package system for container.

  - Image layers
    - It uses the union file system and made from the layer of the changes .
     `docker history officialnameofiamge:latest` This will give you the list of the changes.
     - Eache layer get their own unique SHA number .
     - We are not storing the same stake again and again .for the more then one  .
     - <missing > doesnt measn missing it simply means passs id
     
  - Image tag is left 


# Container Lifetime & Presistant Data
Container are usually immuatable and ephemeral .
"immutable infrasturcture" : only re-deploy containers,never change .
Docker gives us fetaures to ensure these "seperation of concerns "
The problem of the unque data is known as the "persistant data" .
Docker have the solution to these problem Volumes and Bind Mounts .
- Volumes : Make special location outside of container UFS.
- Bind Mounts : link container path to host path . 
 
 - Persistent Data : Volume 
  - Volume need manual deletion .
  - Dockerfile is not part of  image of the metadata .
  - `Docker file` It is the formatted text file which essentialyy servesc
  as an instruction mannual for what contianer should do and ultimately assembeles a docker image ,we use dockefile to contain the commands that should execute the when it is built ,
- Persitant volume
 - The first thing that computer need to worry about is the docker file.
 - Volume need manual deletion .
 - Each time there is new volume with the new release .
   - For testing purpose we have pulled the mysql docker file .
      - Now we are going to inspect the docker file 
        `docker pull ngninx`
        - `docker image inspect nginx` After running this command we wont see the metadata as the docker file is not the part of the metadata .
        - `docker container run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_ENTERY_PASSWORD mysql` This will start the new container with the name of the MYSQL  Need to fix this .
         As soon as we run the container we have the mainy instance behind the door . After running the container we will get the `mount`.
         - `Mount` It is the running container getting its own location  on the host and to store the data .
         - `docker volume ls ` This will list the driver and the volume name .
         - `docker volume inspect volume name `This will list the volume  data .
         - `docker container rm name ` This is to remove the container from the repo .

      
 - Persitant Data : Bind mounting 
  - It maps a host file or directory to container file or directory .
  - Basically just two location pointing to the samr files. 
  - Again skips UFS and host file overwrite any in container
  - Cant use in Dockerfile must be at container .
  - Bound mounts start with the // .
    `docker container exec -it kkr bash` This commannd will run the container and open the terminal .
  // Assignment is left

  # Docker Compose 
  The reason why we need this is :-
   To configure the relationship betweem container .
   To save our docker container run setting easy-to-read file .
   To create one-line developer environment startup .
 - It comprised of 2 seprate but related things 
    - YAML-formatedd file that describe our solution options for :
      - Container 
      - Yaml
      - Volumes 
   - A CLI tool docker-compose used for local dev/test automation with those YAML files .
- docker-compose.yml
Compose YAML has its own version .
YAML file cant be used with the docker-compose command for local docker automation .
 docker-compose.yml is default filename,but any can be used with docker-compose -f .
 - docker-compose cli
   Not design for the production grade tool but suitable for the local development test .
  - Two most common command are 
     - Docker- compose up setup volumes/network and start all containers .
     - Docket -compose down stop all container and remove cont/vol/net .
