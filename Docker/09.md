- This is it. Containers are the next once-in-a-decade shift in infrastructure and process that makesor break you .

- Host to container (Serverless)
- It is the next object to compute .
- The solution is for developer
- Moby dock
- Gordon (Turtle) is the main theme of the  docker .
- Docker is all about the speed 
- Devlop faster 
- Build Faster 
- Test Faster
- Deploy Faster

 - Container are the building block of the docekr
 - `docker version` It will verifiy that wheather cli can talk to engine or not . 
 - `docker info`  It will give most config value
 - `docker`

- `image` An image is the application that we want to run . It it all the binary and   libiray source code that make the application .
- `container` A container is the an instance that image running as a process. 

- `docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx.`
 This will download image 'nginx' from docker hub and will start a new container from that image after that it will opened the port `80` on the host IP . Routed that trafiic to the container IP, port 80 .
 We dont want to run this always so we use `ctrl+c` and type the command like `docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach ngnix
 Detach  will tell the program to run in the background .
