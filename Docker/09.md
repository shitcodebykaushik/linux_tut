- This is it. Containers are the next once-in-a-decade shift in infrastructure and process that makesor break you .

- Host to container (Serverless)
- It is the next object to compute .
- The solution is for developer
- Moby dock
- Gordon (Turtle) is the main theme of the  docker .
- Docker is all about the speed 
- Devlop faster 
- Build Faster 
- Test Faster
- Deploy Faster 
- Update Faster
- Recover Faster

 - Container are the building block of the docekr
 - `docker version` It will verifiy that wheather cli can talk to engine or not . 
 - `docker info`  It will give most config value
 - `docker`

- `image` An image is the application that we want to run . It it all the binary and   libiray source code that make the application .
- `container` A container is the an instance that image running as a process. 

- `docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx.`
 This will download image 'nginx' from docker hub and will start a new container from that image after that it will opened the port `80` on the host IP . Routed that trafiic to the container IP, port 80 .
 We dont want to run this always so we use `ctrl+c` and type the command like `docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach ngnix
 Detach  will tell the program to run in the background .
 
 - What happens in 'docker container run '?
    - There is misconception that the docker is running a container in background but there is lot which is happening in the background .
    - But in depth it looks for the image locally in image cache . If it doesnt find the anything then it will look for the remote image repository (default to docker hub) and download the latest version .
    - Then its going to creates a new container based on the that image and prepare to start it doesn't make a copy of the image ,it just start on the layer of the changes .
    - Then it gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside the docker engine
    - Opens up the port on the host and forward to port in container.
    - Starts the container by using the `CMD` in the image Dockerfile .

- Contianer VS Vm
   - Container are the just process,and it is limited to what rresource they can access.
   - Exist when the process stops .
   - Container run over the host .

    # The homework section is left .

- What go inside the container 
 - `docker top` It will process list in one container.
 - `docker inspect` It will give details of one container config.
 - `docker stats`  It will give the performance stats of all containers

- Getting a shell inside Containers 
`docker run -it --name Proxy nginx bash` This comand will let you run terminal inside the server. The problem is with the git bash as it is not configured yet so use powershell.
