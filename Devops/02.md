# Modularization 
The modularization of code refers to the process of dividing a software program into seprate modules that are independent of each other but work together when the program runs .
- These concept is widely implemented in programming languages through,classes,pacakage,libraries and frameworks facilitating better organization and more efficient of the complex system .
- Rate limiting means protect your api from overuse or abuse by implementing rate limiting .
- Implement logging and monitoring to track API  usuage patterns,performance bottlesnecks and error rates .
- Test cases are specific scenarios used in software testing to verify that a feature or functionality within an application is working  as  expected . Each test provides detailed instructions on what to be tested,how to perform the test and the expected result. The goal is to ensure that the application meets its design .
- `Unit Testing`: This involves testing individual components or pieces of code to ensure each part functions correctly independently. This is often performed by developers as they write the code.
- `Integration Testing`: After unit testing, integration testing verifies that different modules or services work together as expected. This can involve testing interactions between code modules or between different microservices in a microservices architecture.
- `Functional Testing`: This type of testing checks the application against the functional requirements to ensure it behaves as expected. It involves testing user commands, data manipulation, searches, business processes, user screens, and integrations .
- `Regression Testing:` Every time a new feature is added, regression testing ensures that new code changes have not adversely affected existing features of the software.
- `Exploratory Testing:` This is a more informal or unscripted approach to testing where testers explore the software to identify errors by testing the functionality without predefined cases.
- `Automated Testing:` Involves using software tools to run tests that repeat predefined actions, comparing the results to the expected behavior. Automation can be applied to many types of testing, including unit, integration, and regression testing .
- `Software Pipeline` In software  development,particulry in continous integration/continous deployemt(CI/CD) a pipeline represents the automated steps  that source code undergoes from development to deployment ,these steps typically include building the code,running tests and deploying to various environments .
- `Continous Integration` refers to the practice of frequently integration code changes into a shared repository by automatically testing each change. This is usually done several times a day and involves the following steps: Automativd testingm Immeditate feedback mainaitain a single source file .
- `Continous Deployment` refers to the concept of Continuous Integration further by automating the replease of the software to the production environment,ensuring that the code can be deployed at any time .Github actions and Jenkins are the default use of the integration .
-  `Yaml and Scripting` Workflows are defined in YAML files so understanding YAML syntax is important .
- Generative AI means  type of artifical intelligence that is designed to generate new content or data resemble the input it has been trained on .Unlike traditional ai systems,which are primarily programmed to analyze or classify data,generative AI models creates entirely new wheather its text,image music code or other forms of content .
- Generative means ability to produce create or generate something new .
